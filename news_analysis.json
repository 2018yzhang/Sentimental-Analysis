However, this increase is miniscule compared to Shiba Inu, which has increased over 4500% in the past three months.Shiba Inu was created by an anonymous founder and released as an Ethereum token in August 2020. It has a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, which is why the price per SHIB is so low. The token was created to be a \u201cDoge Killer\u201d and is aiming at replacing Dogecoin as the people\u2019s memecoin. As a memecoin, the SHIB token has very little real world value and the majority of its price movement comes from retail investors speculating on the hype of the token. For example, back in May 2021, hype for SHIB on popular social media apps like TikTok propelled the SHIB token to a market capitalization of nearly $14 billion, which was entirely based on demand for the useless coin. After this unprecedented price increase of nearly 12000x from its launch, SHIB cooled off considerably and lost over 75% of its value. For most investors, this signaled the end of Shiba Inu, as the hype died down and retail investors moved on to other projects.However, the Shiba developers and community did not accept this as their fate. Instead, they began creating ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange that used the SHIB token as the primary token. They also created the LEASH token, which is given as a reward to those who provide liquidity on the exchange. Finally, they created the BONE token, which is the governance token and allows for users to vote on the Doggy DAO.Though this may seem like an impressive feat, the reality is that there are already dozens of decentralized exchanges on Ethereum, and ShibaSwap offers nothing unique that would make people want to use it over others like SushiSwap or Uniswap. This is why the ShibaSwap exchange only has around $30 million in daily volume, compared to Uniswap\u2019s $1.2 billion. If Shiba Inu has no real value, and their decentralized exchange is a failure, then why is the coin increasing so heavily over the past few months? There are three main reasons, all of which are purely speculative and do not indicate any potential for future price appreciation.First, an anonymous Ethereum whale bought 6 trillion SHIB, worth about $43 million at the time of the purchase, on September 30th. This brought lots of attention to the coin, as retail investors saw whales buying as a sign that they should as well.Second, Coinbase listed SHIB in mid-September, bringing it to the hundreds of millions of Coinbase users who may not have had access to the coin before. This is by no means an indication that Coinbase has faith in the token, as they have recently been listing every coin possible that they do not think will get them into regulatory trouble. Considering that SHIB is a high-volume coin that is highly speculative, they are able to make lots of money off trading fees, thus giving them a large incentive to list and promote the coin.Finally, there are rumors that Robinhood, one of the biggest brokerages with Millenials and Gen Z, is going to list SHIB. Some of the initial Dogecoin hype came from Robinhood\u2019s listing, and some investors believe that Shiba Inu will repeat Dogecoin\u2019s performance if and when it gets listed on the stock trading platform.Even though Shiba Inu is up significantly over the past few months, it is not an indication that it is a sound investment. At the end of the day, all of the announcements and news relating to the SHIB coin are based purely on speculation and hype, as opposed to real world use cases. It is likely that once this initial wave of excitement dies down, SHIB will fall back to its previous lows, and investors will find interest in another memecoin that is rapidly rising.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3660343","Time":1633878038,"Emotion":"\u504f0 \u751a\u81f3negative","neg":0.04,"neu":0.868,"pos":0.092,"compound":0.9826,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.4913},"1":{"Title":"What are the Most Promising Projects Building on Cardano?","Content":"With the recent launch of smart contracts, the Cardano ecosystem is uniquely positioned to have a \u2018dapp renaissance,\u2019 where lots of new and never-before-seen decentralized applications will be making their initial release. Some of these most promising projects include SundaeSwap, Meld, and ErgoDEX.Cardano\u2019s launch of smart contracts on September 14 was one of the most anticipated events in crypto of 2021. It represents four years of hard work, dedication, and thorough peer-revision in order to create a secure, fast, and decentralized smart contract platform capable of handling global demand. One important piece that helps facilitate the level of security guarantees given to smart contracts is the new smart contract programming language Plutus. This language was specifically created as a way for developers to program Cardano smart contracts, and is quite different from Solidity, the programming language used on Ethereum and all other Ethereum Virtual Machine-based chains, like Polygon, Avalanche, and Binance Smart Chain.Since the Cardano smart contracts require new development, it guarantees that the decentralized applications deploying in the ecosystem will not be simple clones of popular dApps like Uniswap or Compound. This offers investors an incredibly rare opportunity to invest in completely new projects not based on any existing code, which could be incredibly lucrative. Let\u2019s take a look at three of the most promising projects coming to Cardano, what they offer, and when they will be released. One of the most hyped projects is SundaeSwap, a decentralized exchange that already has over 140,000 followers on Twitter. With this type of following, it is almost guaranteed that SundaeSwap will quickly become the DEX with the highest volume on Cardano. SundaeSwap is expected to be Cardano\u2019s version of Uniswap or PancakeSwap, and be an automated market maker exchange that acts as a simple way for anyone to exchange Cardano-based tokens. The SUNDAE token will act as a governance token, offer lower fees on transactions, and share in some of the protocol\u2019s profits. At the moment, the SUNADE token is not available to buy, and it will be released through an initial stakepool offering, or ISO. This is a new token distribution model in which investors who want SUNDAE will have to stake their Cardano to the SundaeSwap validators and slowly earn the token over time. 55% of the total supply of tokens are allocated to the public, which makes it an incredibly fair launch. The SundaeSwap DEX and token are slated to release sometime in mid-Q3, which will most likely be in the middle or end of October. Meld is creating the \u201cBanking Stack for DeFi\u201d on Cardano. They are similar to popular DeFi dApps Aave and Compound, as they allow for users to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies to earn a yield. A money market such as Meld is critical for the success of a smart contract platform, as it offers users a stable place to park their money while they look for other opportunities. Every good smart contract blockchain has a money market, and Meld is looking to be just that for Cardano.The MELD token, which is the governance token of the platform, is currently available to earn through an initial stakepool offering. This offering runs through the end of the year, and gives users .065 MELD per ADA staked per 5 days. With 377 million ADA staked across all of their stakepools, Meld is clearly gaining a lot of popular interest. They plan to launch their platform in Q4, and want to start offering zero interest loans and fiat loans in 2022. ErgoDEX is another decentralized exchange building on Cardano, but they are taking a more unique and exciting approach to token exchange. As their name suggests, the ErgoDEX is also available on Ergo, which is another popular blockchain that Charles Hoskinson, creator of Cardano, has said should easily be a top 10 coin. It currently stands at 120 in terms of market capitalization. ErgoDEX wants to create a platform with liquidity shared between Ergo and Cardano, which is something that has never been seen before and offers a lot of potential in terms of opportunities for investors and liquidity providers. Furthermore, they want to implement both AMM and orderbook capabilities, which will mean more flexibility for buyers and sellers. Currently, not too much is known about the future release of ErgoDEX. What we do know is that development is currently underway, and there is already a beta DEX available on Ergo. It will likely be 2022 before this project releases, but when it does it will be a popular choice due to its new and exciting features. These three projects are some of the most exciting and promising that are building on Cardano. Whether or not they live up to their hype remains to be seen, but their eventual launches and token offerings will undoubtedly be milestones for the greater Cardano ecosystem.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3631214","Time":1632387709,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.007,"neu":0.853,"pos":0.14,"compound":0.9982,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.728,"pos_right":0.272,"compound_right":0.4576,"Total Score":0.91711},"2":{"Title":"Bitpush Research Paper: The Impact of Media and News Coverage on the Price of Bitcoin","Content":"Introduction:Since its inception of 2008, Bitcoin has caught the eye of many, including governments, institutions, and the general public. In this time, there have been numerous developments in the cryptocurrency space, some positive, and others negative. On many occasions, investors associate good or bad news about a specific investment product with price performance, and believe that if they are the first to pick up on a newsworthy event, then they can long or short the asset appropriately, and make a profit. However, this theory has not been tested with Bitcoin, which is still in its infancy compared to traditional assets such as commodities and equities. It is the goal of this paper to discover the relationship between news media and the price of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and recognition. This search will involve an analysis of four types of news: regulatory news, corporate news, celebrity mentions, and traditional media stories. Each category will have its top stories from the past several years analysed in order to see if there is one type of news that increases or decreases Bitcoin\u2019s price more than another. Though the conclusion may not prove with definite evidence or correlation that there is a link between Bitcoin price and news coverage, it will give investors a greater understanding about how all types of media coverage and events impact the nascent cryptocurrency sector. Methodology:One of the most difficult tasks in determining the impact of a news category on an asset\u2019s price is that every story is different in terms of importance, and thus there is an unlimited spectrum across which different stories fall. In order to counteract this effect, each story has been given a ranking, with 1 being the most important and each lower number being less important. This will give the stories with greater significance a higher weighting, and those with a lower significance a lower weighting. Furthermore, a ranking system helps negate the effects of uncorrelated market movement, and helps to remove some of the coincidental price changes. The rankings were chosen by the authors, and are thus subject to debate, but should be agreeable by the general public for the most part. An improvement upon this research would use a more concrete method of ranking the stories, which would prove difficult without lots of data about previous news pieces and their price impacts, which would require machine learning and artificial intelligence. Once each story is ranked in terms of its importance, the absolute value of the percentage change in Bitcoin before and one day after the news was announced is calculated, and is multiplied by the weighting. Each story has a rating of (y-x+1)\/y, where x is the story\u2019s rating and y is the total number of stories. For example, in a category with 5 articles, the top story will have a rating of (5\/5) = 1, the second story will have a rating of (5-2+1)\/5 = 4\/5 = 0.8, and so on. The final result for each category will see a weighted average of news stories and their average impact on the price, which will give an indication of how important the market values those types of stories. Analysis:Corporate News:Mathematical calculation: 1 * 19.48 + 4\/5 * 12.32 + 3\/5 * 8.31 + 2\/5 * 1.3 + 1\/5 * 1.255=7.0184%In our sample of five of the most important stories in the corporate news sector, there was a 7.02% difference in the price of Bitcoin on the day before and after the news broke. Four of the stories were about companies such as Tesla, Square, and Grayscale buying Bitcoin, and one story was about Tesla stopping Bitcoin payments. The spreadsheet with the entire list of stories and their rankings can be found in the bibliography of the paper. This number is significant, as it means that large companies entering or exiting the Bitcoin ecosystem sways the price dramatically in the short-term. The sample size for this type of news was small, as there are not many companies entering and exiting the space frequently. In the future, as more and more companies add Bitcoin to their balance sheet, it will be interesting to analyze if this number increases or decreases. The most significant story in this category was Tesla's acquisition of $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, which saw a near-20% increase in the Bitcoin price after it was announced. There are not enough stories in this category to make a statistically significant conclusion, however the evidence points to the fact that corporate interest in Bitcoin significantly adds to its volatility. Regulatory News:Mathematical Calculation: 1*9.65+.9*11.06+.8*1.24+.7*6.12+.6*3.56+.5*.20+.4*.71 +.3*1.92+.2*4.35+.1*4.2410=2.927% This category, which was initially thought to have one of the highest impacts on the price of Bitcoin, does not seem to have a massive impact day-to-day. Granted, this is still significantly greater than the average daily Bitcoin value change from 2010-2018, according to this tweet. Data could not be found from 2019-2021, however it is expected to be similar in range to the available data. Thus, for day traders and active investors, watching regulatory news is important, as it has signaled a large price change as found in the data. Ten stories were used for this analysis, which is the most of any category, meaning that there is less inherent sampling bias in this data, and it is more likely to be fully accurate. Thus, even though the percentage change is not as high as some of the other categories, it is more likely to be accurate.  As the threat of regulation becomes ever-increasing in the United States and abroad, this data trend could prove incredibly useful in timing the market and making predictions about future price movement. The data suggests that volatility and regulatory news have a correlation with one another, though this could not be explicitly proven without hundreds, if not thousands, of data sources and price points. Celebrity Mention:Mathematical Calculation: 1*4.70+.75*6.8+.5*7.45+.25*7.454=3.84% Celebrity mentions of Bitcoin impact the price of the digital asset by a weighted average of 3.84% according to the data sources. This is an interesting number, as there are many factors to consider. First, there are many definitions of a celebrity, so this data only takes financial and influential mentions as data sources. If it used other mentions, such as Kim Kardashian\u2019s mention of Ethereum Max or Snoop Dogg\u2019s NFT release, there may be a different result. This data used mentions from Elon Musk, Cathie Wood, Mayor Francis Suarez, and Bill Gates, among others. These individuals are influential in finance and cryptocurrencies, while also being known by the general public. If more data points were added, and the definition of a celebrity was broadened, it is likely that the association between Bitcoin volatility and mentions would decrease. This is due to there being thousands, if not tens of thousands, of celebrities around the world who have mentioned Bitcoin in some regard, whether it be positive, negative or neutral, and the majority of celebrities do not have enough following or reporting from mainstream news for their mentions to be noteworthy, thus they would not move the price by any significant margin.  This category, even though it has one of the higher percent changes, is one of the most difficult to accurately predict beforehand. Without reporting from news outlets, celebrities are the same as regular people, in the sense that their mere mention of cryptocurrencies does not warrant a price change. Thus, celebrity mentions are meaningless without proper news coverage and reporting, and determining which celebrities are newsworthy is even more difficult than determining the impact their statement will have on the price of Bitcoin. Traditional Media:Mathematical Calculation: 1*15.20 + .66 * 15.94 + .33 * 2.743=8.875% After news from traditional media outlets was reported, the price of Bitcoin changed significantly, with a weighted average change of 8.875%. This number may seem incredibly high, but there are many confounding variables. In most cases, mainstream media follows trends, so when a news site posts a story about Bitcoin or how to buy Bitcoin, it typically follows a massive price rally, which will either continue or correct significantly after a story is published. Furthermore, only three stories were chosen for this section, each representing the first time the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, and CNN reported on Bitcoin during the 2017 bullrun. This is because repeated stories about the same subject do not have the same impact on an asset. The first time Bitcoin was featured in mainstream media in a positive light was a milestone for the cryptocurrency community, yet now there is not a day that goes by without one of these three media giants mentioning Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. With so little data, and little future data expected as almost every major news outlet covers Bitcoin extensively, there is little use for this data in predicting future price movements. Nonetheless, it is an interesting study into how mainstream media initially impacted Bitcoin\u2019s price during its initial rise to becoming a household name.Conclusion: In the process of evaluating hundreds of news stories, sorting them into relevant categories, and weighting the most important to calculate an average percentage change, it has been found that the news does have a significant impact on the percentage change in Bitcoin, regardless of the category. For news relating to corporations and their adoption of Bitcoin, there is a weighted average price change of around 7%. For regulatory news, the weighted price change is 2%. For celebrity mentions, the weighted price change is 3.84%, and the first reporting of Bitcoin from mainstream media had a near-9% impact on the price. This is compared to the average daily price change for Bitcoin, which is always less than 1% in either the positive or negative direction.Though this data is compelling, it is far from conclusive and cannot prove causation between news and data, though it does suggest a level of correlation. There is also a sampling bias, as it is impossible to accurately rate news stories based on importance without using some level of subjectivity. In future analysis, more data points, sampling from random individuals to rank the importance of stories, and more accurate statistical modelling could be used to find a more accurate result. Still, regardless of what methods are employed, finding the objective truth in data that is entirely human-driven is difficult, and would require an understanding of not only statistics but also human psychology and the movement of the markets. The biggest takeaway from this report is the importance of news and cryptocurrency media in the price volatility of Bitcoin. Like with any asset, news moves Bitcoin, thus any investors looking to capitalize on day-to-day movement may have an advantage over other investors by knowing which types of news change the price the most on a day-to-day basis.

With the amount of hype surrounding these projects, it is surprising that nothing has had an official launch yet. This is due to the development hurdles and concurrency issues that the Cardano blockchain faces, among other issues.At 5:44pm Eastern Time on September 14th, the Cardano blockchain made history with its release of smart contract functionality through the Alonzo hard fork. This upgrade, which has been anticipated for over 4 years, finally allows Cardano to be a smart contract platform comparable to the likes of Etheruem.Since that release about a week ago, there have been no real projects that have been released on the blockchain. The main reason for this is the difficulty in developing Cardano dApps due to the concurrency issue. Unlike Ethereum, Cardano uses a transaction model known as extended unspent transaction output, or eUTXO. Bitcoin was the first blockchain to implement UTXO, and the way it works is analogous to paying for something with cash: If person A owes person B $3, Person A will give Person B a $5 bill, then receive $2 in change. This way, the entire $5 is used in the transaction, but then any remaining balance is returned to the user. For Cardano and Bitcoin, whenever a user sends crypto, the entire balance is sent with the transaction, then is immediately returned back to the original user. Ethereum uses a much more simple model that is analogous to a bank account, where only the exact amount required to pay for something is taken from a user\u2019s account whenever a transaction takes place. As one can imagine, it is much more difficult to program applications that can be used by multiple people at the same time when the entire balance has to be received and returned each time a transaction takes place. This causes what is known as the concurrency issue, and it could cause slowdowns on decentralized exchanges and other Cardano dApps, since each user would have to wait for one user to finish before their transaction began.Even though the eUTXO model provides many benefits over the bank account-esque model, such as allowing for easier access to blockchain memory and more guarantees for contract executions, the concurrency issue is severe enough to have somewhat stopped projects from launching simultaneously with Cardano\u2019s smart contract release. Nevertheless, many top Cardano projects, such as SundaeSwap, Meld, and Ergodex, are creating solutions to the concurrency issue that should allow for multiple users to use their dApps at the same time without issue. Each project seems to be coming up with their own solution, and some projects, like SundaeSwap, are being secretive about their solution. This is likely because they do not want other projects to copy their code and beat them to market or steal some of the hype from their eventual launch.Another reason that Cardano DeFi dApps are not rapidly releasing is due to the programming hurdle that developers need to overcome before deploying smart contracts. Up until now, the majority of smart contract blockchain, including Etheruem, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Avalanche, have had their smart contracts programmed in the Solidity programming language. Even though this language is relatively simple to learn for developers, it has some drawbacks, namely the lack of security guarantees, which lead to exploits and hacks being commonplace on these blockchains.Cardano created their own programming language known as Plutus, which is much more secure and offers certain guarantees to programmers to make development much more safe. Plutus is based on the Haskell programming language, which was created in the 90s but has yet to see a massive amount of adoption. This means that programmers who are wanting to build on Cardano are required to not only learn this new language but also program with it, which is a time-consuming process. In the future, when there are more Plutus programmers, Cardano dApp development will be much more streamlined. Furthermore, Cardano is looking into a solution that would allow programmers to deploy dApps using Solidity, which would open up the development environment to tens of thousands of developers around the world who already know the language. Even though Cardano\u2019s smart contracts are not rolling out as fast as some anticipated, there is a legitimate reason for that being the case. Additionally, the concurrency issue seems to be a one-time problem that many projects have already solved, and thus it will not impact any future projects after the initial wave of decentralized applications releases. At first glance the lack of smart contracts may seem like a legitimate concern, but after closer analysis it becomes obvious that it is a small bump in the road in the longer term goal of Cardano to be the world\u2019s main smart contract platform.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3625850","Time":1632153530,"Emotion":"-1","neg":0.038,"neu":0.853,"pos":0.109,"compound":0.9959,"neg_right":0.239,"neu_right":0.761,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":-0.296,"Total Score":-0.102215},"4":{"Title":"What is the NFT Project \u2018Loot\u2019 and How Valuable Could it Be","Content":"Loot is an NFT project that is taking the cryptoverse by storm. Unlike other NFT collections, Loot is entirely decentralized, and fully relies on the community to give it value. Though it may one day be the biggest NFT project, it is currently overvalued, and more of a cool experiment than the next generation of NFTs.Loot has been taking over the NFT space for the past couple of weeks. Since its surprise release on August 27, it has amassed over $256 million in trading volume, and each of the 8,000 NFTs are selling for upwards of $20,000. Let\u2019s take a look at Loot, its future development plans, and why exactly it has caught everyone\u2019s attention.Loot was created by Dom Hoffman, who is well-known for his creation of the video-sharing platform Vine. Each Loot NFT is a text file-esque list of items commonly found in fantasy games, such as a \u201cWand of the Twins\u201d or \u201cDragonskin Boots of Skill.\u201d Unlike other NFT projects, the artwork is not the main appeal, and these NFTs are as boring as possible from an artwork perspective. Hoffman intended the lack of artwork to be a feature, and has called for the community to create their own interpretations of what the text signifies. There is no company, entity, or any other organization officially working on their project, and it is now completely up to the community to create whatever they want using the NFTs. It acts as a type of fantasy or role-playing game, where imagination is the key driver behind what the project will become. This is in stark contrast to other NFT projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club, where a centralized company decides what functionality the NFTs serve. Part of the main initial surge in popularity from this collection came from the fact that all of the NFTs were completely free to mint after they were released. In only three weeks, the community behind Loot has created a vast array of different resources and expansion packs. Some of these include Adventure Gold, a token that governs the Loot project, Potion text files, Enemy NFTs, and much more. Designers have also begun creating images for some of the text items, which makes them more valuable by giving them some sort of digital representation.The idea of having a completely decentralized and community-run project has many in the cryptocurrency space excited, including Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum.Though this project is incredibly interesting and fascinating as a case study, it is certainly extremely overvalued at its current prices, especially given the small amount of value that has been added by the community. While it is true that the community behind Loot has been monumental in giving it its current valuation, they have done nothing that would make owning a Loot NFT worthwhile or extremely tempting, but instead made minor improvements. Additionally, the idea of Loot giving users items for a fantasy game is intriguing, but also has yet to become reality, and likely will not for a long time. One argument may be that Loot NFTs have already priced in the future updates and apps that could be built around the project. However, nobody knows what these updates could be, as there are no official developers, roadmap, or whitepaper.Furthermore, with the future of Loot being entirely decided by the community, and there not being any paid developers, there is a severe lack of incentive for Loot to continue to be developed once the hype dies down. Even though it is one of the most discussed NFT projects today, it may not be in a month, and the hype dying down is a matter of when, not if. It is true that in the future, given enough development around Loot, the NFTs could be given real value and get them to a point where they are truly worth $20,000 each, if not significantly more, and become the largest and most popular NFT project with limitless potential. However, at the moment it is merely an interesting case study on what would happen when a community is in total control of an asset, and a side effect of the NFT market bubble.

This makes it difficult to determine what the market will do next, but signs point to a continuation of the current trajectory and a general increase in the valuation of the market, mainly due to project upgrades and marketing incentives.Even though cryptocurrencies have always been volatile, the last few weeks have had extremely explosive price actions. Flash crashes that see the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization fall by 10% are then followed the very next day by 25% price increases for some of the top assets. This choppy and cyclical nature has made predicting the next move of the cryptocurrency market difficult. Let\u2019s zoom out and look at the general reasons for the increases and corrections and determine what the medium-term movement of the market will look like. The cryptocurrency market is currently deep into a bull run that has lasted for the majority of 2021. The entire market capitalization is up around 300% year-to-date, going from $700 million to around $2.1 billion today, with a peak in May of $2.5 billion. Even though growth may not be as fast as it was in early summer, it is still happening at a rapid rate, especially compared to the previous bear market of 2018-2020. Bull markets in crypto typically last for about a year, then are followed by a multiple-year bear market that dominates the industry. This has been seen multiple times, the last time being in the 2017 bull run followed by the bear market, and may be seen again in the future. If so, and if investors are anticipating this event, they may be selling off some of their assets. Other investors may think the bear market is still a long way off and are continuing to buy, which would explain the recent volatility in both directions. Another factor is the newfound mainstream nature of cryptocurrencies, especially NFTs. Before this year, hardly anyone knew what Bitcoin was. Now, there are ads during MLB baseball games telling users to buy NFT images of the stadium. This type of mainstream attention has been bringing new investors into the space, and helps explain the overall upward trend.At the same time, this NFT craze has reached complete mania, and there are now images of rocks and other random items selling for millions of dollars. This is completely unprecedented, and undoubtedly a bubble which could pop at any moment, which is also causing more speculation than usual in the markets. With all that being said, the medium-term outlook is still positive for cryptocurrencies for two main reasons. The first reason is the sheer amount of upgrades and announcements being released in the coming months. For example, Cardano is releasing smart contracts tomorrow, which has been anticipated for four years and promises to be a true Ethereum competitor. Additionally, Ethereum 2.0 is scheduled to launch its next phase in early 2022, and recently released EIP-1559, making ETH deflationary. Bitcoin is also now legal tender in El Salvador, which is a huge milestone and should increase investor confidence in the digital currency. These upgrades, along with many others for lesser-known coins, have continued to cause excitement in the space and help justify high valuations. Additionally, incentive programs on smart contract platforms have also been responsible for propping up smart contract cryptocurrencies and DeFi projects. The first of these was Avalanche\u2019s Rush incentive program, which is giving $180 million AVAX in incentives to DeFi projects like Aave and Curve. These rewards help to prop up the interest rates for those looking to loan out their crypto or become a liquidity provider, thus increasing the total value locked in these DeFi protocols and increasing their overall value. Since Avalanche\u2019s initial announcement, many other blockchains have followed suit, such as Fantom, Harmony, and Algorand. This race to incentivize users to use their blockchains may be hurting the budgets of the companies behind these projects, but is making using DeFi platforms incredibly lucrative for investors, thus helping to prop up the market. It is effectively redistributing money from these companies\u2019 treasuries to the pockets of investors. As long as the incentive programs continue to run and upgrades continue to be released, the cryptocurrency market should continue to slowly increase in prices. Though there may be days of large corrections, they will not define the overall trend, and will instead be a blip in the chart that will go largely unnoticed in the future. Instead of trying to time the market, the best method to achieve gains in both the medium-term and the long-term is to dollar cost average into solid cryptocurrency projects, and take advantage of the liquidity incentives while they last.

Even though this coin may seem like a great investment at first glance, a deeper inspection reveals this coin\u2019s ulterior motives and lack of true value.Hex is a highly controversial cryptocurrency and has been since its creation in late 2019. Let\u2019s take a look at what Hex is, what it promises, and why people are skeptical of it to determine whether or not it truly is a scam.Hex was created in December 2019 by Richard Heart. The website states that Hex and the HEX token are created to be \u201cthe first high interest Blockchain Certificate of Deposit.\u201d One of the most prominent wordings on the website is the statement that users can earn over 40% a year staking their HEX. The reason that Hex calls itself a blockchain certificate of deposit is because users can choose to lock their HEX for between 1 and 5555 days, and earn interest on that deposit which averages to a 40% APY. This is similar to a traditional bank savings account or CD, but offers a significantly higher interest rate. Up until now, HEX\u2019s price has seen monumental growth. Since its initial release, the price of HEX has increased over 10,287x, meaning that anyone who invested $100 at the start of the project is now a millionaire. Currently, there are over 200,000 addresses holding HEX, and that number seems to be growing every day. They also claim their current market capitalization is $250 billion, though this number cannot be verified by outside sources. All of these accomplishments may make the coin seem too good to be true, and many argue that this is exactly the case. One of the main arguments against HEX is that the coin has no fundamental value. It hopes to be like Bitcoin, in the sense that people think it has value thus it increases in price. However, unlike Bitcoin, it is not established and does not have its own blockchain but instead runs on Ethereum. Many other coins have tried and failed to be the next Bitcoin, and there is no reason that Hex is different. Without any demand for the token, it can offer whatever interest rate it wants, and it still does not gain any value. Second, they heavily advertise their coin to the general public and always use wording about how much the coin has increased since its release. There is not a single legitimate project that brags about its earnings as a way to get investors interested in the project, whether in the cryptocurrency or traditional market. This tactic is simply trying to get the average investor to feel FOMO, fear of missing out, about future increases in HEX price. However, the opposite is more likely to be true, as now that HEX is a massive cryptocurrency it is nearly impossible for it to see a 10,000x, or even a 10x, gain. One would think that if HEX was a legitimate project that is revolutionizing the interest-bearing banking system that it would have listings on major cryptocurrency exchanges. Instead, HEX is not listed on a single major exchange, and the vast majority of its trading volume comes from decentralized exchanges like 1inch and Uniswap, where literally any coin can be listed without being subject to approval. Additionally, Hex\u2019s website has an entire section dedicated to dismissing the idea that HEX is a scam. There is not a single project that is not a scam that has to convince people otherwise.For those who do not want to simply believe one article on the internet, and instead want to do their own research, you may run into a problem: Hex does not have a whitepaper for their cryptocurrency. Every major project that is trying to accomplish something in the cryptocurrency space opts to create a whitepaper, however Hex has not, meaning it is incredibly difficult to find unbiased and transparent information about the project. It is likely that HEX\u2019s inclusion on CoinMarketCap will be rolled back after cryptocurrency experts and others begin to criticize the project for its baseless claims and lack of value. There was a reason that CoinMarketCap refused to acknowledge it as a legitimate cryptocurrency until now, but the reasoning is unknown as to why they changed their minds and decided to list it. Cryptocurrency investors may want to stay away from HEX, as it has characteristics of a scam cryptocurrency like BitConnect. Though it may not explicitly be a scam in the sense of taking money from investors, it does not have any fundamental value, and will likely fall into obscurity over the coming years.

The DeFi base interest rate has cemented itself around the 20% range, so let\u2019s look at a couple ways that this yield can be made.The biggest reason for DeFi\u2019s adoption is its high interest rates that almost always beat the rates offered by traditional bank savings and checking accounts. DeFi projects like Aave and Compound, which facilitate blockchain-based money markets, offer yield on all sorts of different assets, and truly help investors let their money work for them while they sleep.Recently, the DeFi base rate, or the baseline for what one can expect to earn with stablecoins in DeFi, is sitting around 20% for a multitude of reasons. This number is subject to change in the future, and will likely go down, but for now represents gains over twice as high as one would expect by investing in the stock market, and leads to an initial investment being doubled in around three years. For anyone in DeFi right now, the gains are incredibly lucrative but also come with many different risks and uncertainties. Let\u2019s look at five of the top ways in DeFi to earn a stable yield above 20%, how they work, and how long we can expect it to last.The first and most well-known option is Anchor Protocol, the high-yield savings platform based on the Terra blockchain. Anchor allows users to deposit UST, the algorithmic stablecoin of the Terra ecosystem, and earn about 20% APY. Anchor works like other DeFi money markets, like Aave and Compound, but with a unique added feature: when users want to borrow money from the protocol, they put up a bonded asset as collateral. These bonded assets, like bETH or bLUNA, are staked and are continuously earning interest while sitting as collateral, and any staking rewards are used to reward the lenders. With the interest rate for LUNA sitting at around 5% and there being a collateralization ratio of 200%, this staking accounts for half of the interest rate that lenders receive. On the other side, borrowers are currently incentivized to loan because Anchor is giving out their ANC token to anyone who borrows money. The distribution rate of ANC is currently 12% higher than the borrow rate, meaning that they are effectively paying people to borrow money from the platform. This is clearly not sustainable over the long run, and it remains to be seen whether or not the high interest rates will last once the incentives dry up. Nonetheless, it currently offers a stable, high yield that does not appear to be going away anytime soon.Another enticing option for earning a yield comes from yield farming liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges like Sushi and Dfyn. Every DEX needs one thing to succeed: liquidity. Without liquidity, nobody can make trades without significantly impacting the price of an asset, and as a result they are paying a price that does not reflect the asset\u2019s true market value. DEXes offer liquidity incentives on some token pairs so that this slippage is more uncommon. Typically, these liquidity incentives are paid out in the native token of the DEX, like CAKE for PancakeSwap or SUSHI for SushiSwap. One of the main risks with providing liquidity is the risk of impermanent loss, which is when the price of one asset increases more than the other. Since providing liquidity requires assets to keep a 1:1 ratio in terms of dollar value in most cases, a price increase in one asset means that you would have been better off not providing liquidity and instead simply holding the asset. However, if the price goes back down, the loss goes away, which is why it is impermanent. Additionally, if the liquidity incentives are high enough, the impermanent loss may not matter.Two DEXes providing high APYs on relatively safe pools are Dfyn on the Polygon blockchain and Sushi on the Harmony blockchain. Dfyn is offering 38% APY on their UST-USDT pair, and 28% on their USDC-USDT pair, all paid out in DFYN. Sushi is offering 20% on bscBUSD-BUSD, and 22% on BTC-ETH pairs, paid out in both ONE and SUSHI. Of these two, even though Dfyn\u2019s rates are higher, their coin is less established and more volatile compared to SUSHI and ONE, so Sushi may be the safer option.If providing liquidity on cryptocurrencies feels like too much risk, there is the option of providing liquidity for tokenized stock pairs on Mirror Protocol. Mirror, which is also based on the Terra blockchain, allows users to mint, trade, and short tokenized stocks like Apple, Amazon, and Tesla. They also offer yield farming incentives for providing liquidity on their trading pairs. For providing liquidity on pairs like AAPL-UST, investors can earn 34%, and even higher for more volatile stocks.For the average investor, 20% gains yearly is neary impossible to consistently achieve. However, thanks to the power of DeFi, this is now possible, at least in the short term. As more users come into DeFi, the returns will likely go down, as they are spread among more people. Thus, today's DeFi users should take advantage of these rates while they can and hopefully become rich enough that it will not matter when they are lowered.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3600766","Time":1630938655,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.023,"neu":0.801,"pos":0.175,"compound":0.9993,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.49965},"8":{"Title":"First Cardano, Then Solana, Now What? Which Cryptocurrencies are Likely to Increase Next?","Content":"Over the past few weeks, many of the top cryptocurrencies have seen incredibly impressive gains. Though these have been great for people holding coins like Cardano and Solana, many others are left wondering which cryptocurrencies will be next and why.When looking at recent price action, it is easy to see that the cryptocurrency market is currently in a bull cycle. Almost everything is up tens, if not hundreds, of percentage points per week, and choosing a losing coin is almost harder than choosing a winning coin. That being said, some coins are increasing much more than others, and those who are able to catch 1000% gains are doing significantly better than those only able to get 10% gains. Let\u2019s take a look at some cryptocurrencies that may be poised to significantly increase in price over the next coming weeks. One pick which is still relatively unknown in the cryptocurrency community is Fantom. Fantom is a smart contract platform that boasts high throughput and low costs, while also being EVM-compatible, meaning that any dApp on Ethereum can easily migrate to their blockchain. Though there are many similar Ethereum alternatives available, the main reason that Fantom might increase is their new DeFi incentives program, which is offering over $300 million to DeFi projects on the Fantom blockchain. This is incredibly significant, as the Avalanche cryptocurrency has shot up nearly 500% since their announcement of a $180 million incentive program and now has a market capitalization of $10 billion. Even though Fantom is currently up around 600% since its July low, it only has a market capitalization of $3 billion. Even now, it reaching the same highs as Avalanche would mean that the coin has the potential to do another 300% gain, which is entirely possible. Like Fantom, Harmony is another smart contract blockchain that could see big gains in the near future. Their main selling point is that they are the first project to implement a sharded proof of stake blockchain, meaning that they can scale incredibly efficiently while also only costing one one-thousandth of a cent for transactions. If they follow in the footsteps of Avalanche and Fantom and release some sort of DeFi incentive program, the price of the ONE token could increase dramatically. It currently sits at a market capitalization near $1 billion, and if it can garner the same attention as other DeFi incentive programs, it could easily reach new all-time highs. Of course, this DeFi incentive program is not a guarantee and they may decide to spend their treasury money in other areas, but for many investors the reward is worth the risk. The next pick, which is safer than the previous two, is Ethereum. Even though it already has a market capitalization of $450 billion, positive news, continued development, and general public adoption make ETH an incredibly solid pick. Ethereum 2.0, which is a monumental upgrade to the blockchain that will introduce sharding, proof of stake, and a decrease in transaction costs, is coming out in late 2021 or early 2022. This is the biggest upgrade to ever happen on the Ethereum blockchain and promises to help the blockchain achieve its goal of being the \u2018World's Computer.\u2019 If ETH can have a market capitalization of $450 billion when it is hardly usable due to high fees and long transaction times, $1 trillion is a very achievable number after ETH 2.0's release. Even though these picks all seem like solid bets to increase in the short-term, nothing is guaranteed, especially in the world of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the promise of \u2018getting rich quick\u2019 is a dream that is nearly impossible to achieve without unbelievable luck. For the average investor, the best path to cryptocurrency riches is through dollar cost averaging, or taking a fixed amount of money to invest in certain cryptocurrencies every week or so. For those that are willing to take a risk on a short-term play, these cryptocurrencies offer an exciting opportunity to do so, but it should be treated as a gamble and not a retirement plan.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3598989","Time":1630843379,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.023,"neu":0.801,"pos":0.177,"compound":0.9984,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.819,"pos_right":0.181,"compound_right":0.3939,"Total Score":0.907725},"9":{"Title":"Loopring founder Daniel Wang gave a speech \u201cCounterfactual Wallet & NFTs on Loopring\u201d at EDCON 2021","Content":"On August 29th, Loopring founder Daniel Wang was invited to participate at EDCON 2021 and gave a speech entitled \u201cCounterfactual Wallet & NFTs on Loopring\u201d.The speech proposed a new layer-2 counterfactual wallet that allows users to use the layer-2 smart wallet for free with a \"use first, deploy later\" method.

Even though it has recently shot up from a top 80 to a top 20 project, it may still have room to grow, especially if they continue to find mainstream adoption and interest from DeFi farmers. Recently, Ethereum alternatives have been increasing in popularity. This is mainly due to the congestion on the Ethereum network, leading to high fees and slow transaction times. For example, a simple Uniswap transaction on the Ethereum network may cost upwards of $50, which is unacceptable for day-to-day use. Though this issue will be solved with the release of Ethereum 2.0 in 2022, hundreds of thousands of users are looking for a solution that is usable today.One of the most viable solutions is Avalanche, a smart contract platform that is EVM-compatible, meaning that any projects on Ethereum can easily migrate to this new platform. Avalanche\u2019s mainnet was launched in September 2020, and since then it has amassed over 1000 validators, 200,000 daily transactions, and an $8.5 billion market capitalization for AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche ecosystem.Avalanche\u2019s most unique feature is its consensus mechanism, which is also known as Avalanche. Without getting into too much technical detail, this consensus mechanism allows for near-instant finality between transactions and manages three different blockchains: the X-Chain, which manages the AVAX coin and other tokens, the P-Chain, which allows for the creation of custom Avalanche chains, and the C-Chain, which is where smart contracts are deployed and executed. Additionally, the Avalanche consensus is capable of handling 4,500 transactions per second, compared to around 14 on Ethereum, while being more decentralized and costing one-tenth of an Ethereum transaction.These advantages, along with a bridge from Ethereum to Avalanche, have made the platform a hotbed for new users and DeFi activity. This is mainly due to \u201cAvalanche Rush,\u201d a marketing effort by the Avalanche team which promises to offer $180 million in incentives to DeFi applications on the blockchain. This program has been working incredibly well, as Benqi, the money market on Avalanche, reached $1 billion in total value locked only a few days after its August launch. Additionally, Aave and Curve are planning to build on Avalanche and be part of the incentive program, and Sushi is already deployed. It is a great sign whenever these well-established dApps decide to build on a certain blockchain, as they are putting their reputation on the line, something that they only do for blockchains that they believe are secure and have a bright future. The technology, adoption, and promise of Avalanche explain why it has recently tripled in value, but is there still room for growth? At its current price it is hard to argue that Avalanche is still undervalued. It has the same market capitalization as Polygon, and even though Avalanche does have superior technology it has significantly less value locked in its ecosystem than Polygon, meaning that there is less capital deployed and being used on Avalanche, giving the token less demand. Furthermore, the rest of Avalanche\u2019s roadmap does not have any major upgrades in 2021 and they have yet to release a longer-facing roadmap, so it is difficult to determine if there will be any promising upgrades in the medium-term.That being said, they have been creating many partnerships within the cryptocurrency space, such as with Chainlink, and they have venture capital backing from firms like Andreessen Horowitz. Any time a big name in the traditional finance or cryptocurrency world backs a project, it means that there is a group of highly-educated researchers and analysts who have carefully studied a project and have determined it is worth an investment. This type of research is much more thorough than what most average people do, so a good strategy for most people would be to follow what smart money is doing. Additionally, all fees on the Avalanche blockchain are burned, which means that AVAX could become deflationary, leading to a higher price.The Avalanche ecosystem is experiencing some of its best growth ever, and does not show any signs of slowing down. However, once their incentive program dries up, it is possible that value will move to another blockchain that is offering better incentives. At the end of the day, the average person cares about yield and security, and at the moment Avalanche is the best for both so it is the blockchain of choice for yield farmers everywhere, at least for the time being.

When this happens, there will be an entirely new ecosystem of DeFi applications, and they are guaranteed to be unique from those we have already seen. This will cause the creation of new revolutionary dApps and opportunities for early adopters.The underdog story of Cardano is well known within the cryptocurrency space: after leaving Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson created Cardano as a new smart contract platform that would deliver on the promises that Ethereum failed to live up to, namely proof of stake consensus, high transaction throughput, and low fees. After four years of development, research, and peer revision, Cardano is finally ready for their biggest update yet: the Alonzo hard fork. This hard fork will allow for smart contracts to be published and deployed on Cardano, leading to the possibility of Cardano-based tokens, NFTs, and decentralized applications. Not only is Cardano unique in terms of its speed and high level of decentralization but also in its developer environment. Most Ethereum alternatives, such as Binance Smart Chain and Polygon, are still Ethereum Virtual Machine-based, which means they are able to run code that was meant for Ethereum with no changes needed. Smart contracts for Ethereum and EVM-based chains are written in a programming language called Solidity, which is similar to Javascript, another popular web development language. In the five or so years since Ethereum and Solidity were released, it has amassed a large developer community, and there are now countless tutorials, videos, and workshops available to help developers get started with the language. Cardano, on the other hand, will not be immediately EVM-compatible. There are plans to add this support in the future, but it could be years before this is available. Instead, developers will have to program smart contracts in Plutus, a new and easy-to-program smart contract language, and Haskell, a programming language that has been around since 1990 but has yet to see mainstream adoption.The use of Plutus instead of Solidity is quite significant for the growth of Cardano\u2019s ecosystem. On one hand, it means that popular Ethereum dApps like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound, along with every other Ethereum dApp, will not be able to easily port over to Cardano. This may lead to a lack of liquidity and dApps on Cardano in its first months, which could stop some users from migrating to the platform. On the other hand, Cardano offers a fresh slate for both developers and users alike, and is guaranteed to have unique and never-before-seen projects, unlike a blockchain like Binance Smart Chain, whose EVM-compatibility means that all of its major dApps are simply clones of existing Ethereum dApps. Though initial development may be slow on the platform, we are guaranteed to see the next generation of DeFi built on Cardano, and that may lead to the creation of the next Uniswaps and Aaves, and other applications that have not even been thought of yet. Furthermore, since Plutus offers greater ease of development and built-in security verification methods, we should see less exploits and hacks from applications, leading to less negative news that slows the rate of adoption.Furthermore, the yield farming opportunities can be expected to be incredibly lucrative, especially immediately after the September 12 launch date. Projects with governance tokens need to incentivize users to not only use their platform but also use Cardano itself, so they will be giving away tokens for simple activities such as holding ADA, providing liquidity on their platform, or even borrowing money. This has been seen in other blockchains, like Harmony, where users can currently earn nearly 50% by staking BTC and ETH in a Sushiswap liquidity pool. The entirely new Cardano ecosystem will give both developers and users alike the opportunity to experience an entirely fresh smart contract ecosystem, with new projects, tokens, and features. Whether or not this ecosystem is enticing enough to make Cardano and ADA as valuable as Ethereum remains to be seen, but it is certain that competition within the smart contract space is healthy, as it gives all projects the incentive to continuously develop and upgrade, leading to a better experience for everyone.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3573624","Time":1629494012,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.028,"neu":0.796,"pos":0.176,"compound":0.9988,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.4994},"12":{"Title":"What is Terra, the Fastest Growing Cryptocurrency in the Top 25?","Content":"Terra and its UST stablecoin are part of a blockchain project aiming to be the backbone of the global payments system. Through their Anchor Protocol and Mirror Protocol, they are able to act as a decentralized bank offering higher yields and lower fees. Their upcoming update, Columbus-5, will lead to greater efficiencies and scarcity for LUNA.For the past year, DeFi has been promising to be the next generation of banks by removing the middleman and offering greater yield opportunities for users. A lot of the use in DeFi comes from stablecoins, which are coins that are pegged 1:1 to another asset, typically the US dollar. Most large stablecoins are centralized, meaning there is a registered entity that holds the collateral for the stablecoin, ensuring that it keeps its peg. Though this is a simple solution, it creates many problems, as the centralized company behind a stablecoin can effectively control who holds it and what it can be spent on, which makes them no better than our current payment solutions. Terra and the UST stablecoin are combating this issue, and its fast adoption is why Terra\u2019s LUNA coin is up nearly 500% in less than a month.Terra was created by Do Kwon and the Korea-based Terraform Labs. The Terra blockchain mainnet released in April 2019, and uses LUNA as its native cryptocurrency. In some aspects, Terra resembles smart contract blockchains like Ethereum, as it allows for smart contracts to be created and deployed on the Terra blockchain. However, it also has an incredibly unique and exciting feature that sets it apart from other projects: the UST stablecoin.  UST is a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin, meaning it does not have a 1:1 backing with real US dollars. Instead, it uses the LUNA coin as an algorithmic stabilization method. Anyone can mint UST by burning their Luna, so burning $1 of LUNA will create $1 of UST. This also works in the reverse direction, so $1 of UST can be burned to create $1 of LUNA. This inherently ties the two coins together, and makes the success of LUNA rely on the adoption of UST. The more UST is minted, the more LUNA is required to be burned, which means there is less supply, leading to a price increase. The UST stablecoin, which was released in late 2020, already has a market capitalization of over $2 billion. Since its adoption is the main driver of LUNA growth, the Terraform Labs team has been focusing on increasing its adoption through a number of methods, mainly through bridges to other blockchains. UST can be found on Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and soon-to-be Polkadot. The Terra blockchain was also built using the Cosmos SDK, which means it will soon be interoperable with the entire Cosmos ecosystem. UST is not only being used in traditional DeFi activities such as liquidity provision on Uniswap, but there are also revolutionary DeFi applications built on the Terra blockchain. One of these is Mirror Protocol, which is the largest synthetic stock protocol with a total value of nearly $2 billion. Using Mirror, anyone can provide UST as collateral to mint a stock, such as Apple, Tesla, or even GameStop. They can then use this stock, which is pegged to its real-world price through the use of oracles, as they would any other cryptocurrency token.Another exciting protocol being built on Terra is Anchor Protocol, which calls itself the \u201cGold Standard for Passive Income on the Blockchain.\u201d This protocol allows users to deposit UST and receive a stable 20% annual percent yield. This high yield is accomplished by leveraging the staking rewards from multiple blockchains, including Terra, Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot. Anyone can deposit these cryptocurrencies into Anchor, and then the coins\u2019 yield is used to achieve this interest rate. One exciting update coming to Terra on September 9th is the release of Columbus-5, the next upgrade to the Terra blockchain. The main feature that users are excited about is the burning of LUNA transaction fees, which now go to the Terra community treasury. This will have a similar effect to what EIP-1559 did for Ethereum, and will be another method by which the LUNA supply will be continually shrinking. It will also enable even more interoperability with top blockchains, furthering the influence of UST.Terra holders have a lot to be excited about over the coming months, which has been reflected in recent price action. The main risk in holding LUNA is if there is some sort of unforeseen event that causes the UST peg to break, or a lack of adoption of UST. However, as more blockchains and exchanges adopt UST, this risk becomes less probable, and UST comes closer to its goal of being the backbone for the global payments infrastructure.

Is it Overvalued?","Content":"Cardano, a decentralized smart contract platform, has seen massive gains over the past week. This is mainly due to growing excitement about the release of smart contract functionality and the potential for the project to overtake Ethereum. Given its current market capitalization, it may be overvalued, but only if it fails to live up to its promise of being a popular global smart contract platform.In the cryptocurrency markets, it isn\u2019t uncommon to see a coin increase by double digits in a week, or even in a day. However, it is incredibly rare for a top 5 coin to double in less than a month, which is exactly what Cardano has done in the past 4 weeks, and it is now nearing a market capitalization of nearly $65 billion. Let\u2019s take a look at Cardano, what it offers, and determine if it is now overvalued. Cardano is a smart contract platform created by Charles Hoskinson in 2017. It promises the capability to change the world through their decentralized technology, and offers the potential to revolutionize governance, finance, education, and even agriculture. One of its main competitors is Ethereum, which is the first smart contract platform ever created. In order to set itself apart, Cardano has taken a unique approach to development, where they focus on peer-revision and publishing research papers to ensure their technology is ready for use before deploying it. This means that development of the Cardano platform has been painstakingly slow, but promises to be secure and ready for real-world use. Cardano uses a proof of stake consensus model, which means users can stake ADA, the native asset of the Cardano blockchain, to help secure the network and receive transaction fees. At the moment, staking yields around 5-7% and is a no-brainer for anyone holding ADA. It can be done through a wallet such as the Daedalus Wallet or Yoroi browser extension. One of the main drawbacks of Ethereum is its high fees and slow transaction times. Cardano boasts fees as low as 10 cents, and can handle 2,000 transactions per second today with a theoretical maximum of 1,000,000. For reference, Ethereum can currently handle 13 transactions per second. Cardano\u2019s most important upgrade, the Alonzo hard fork, was recently scheduled for release on September 12. This upgrade, which is part of the Gougen phase on Cardano's roadmap, will finally bring smart contract functionality to the Cardano blockchain, which up until now has only been useful for transferring ADA and staking. This will finally make Cardano capable of having tokens, decentralized applications, and DeFi protocols on their blockchain, which will make it a true Ethereum competitor.On the surface it may seem like Cardano has a massive edge over Ethereum, due to their more efficient transactions and better technology. Thus, Cardano deserves the market capitalization of Ethereum, if not higher, which would give ADA a price around $12 or more. However, this is not exactly the case, and there are many other variables to consider.First, just like Bitcoin, Ethereum has a first mover advantage. This means that even though Ethereum\u2019s technology is not as good as Cardano\u2019s, there is already a developer community of over 100,000 on the blockchain and millions of users of Ethereum\u2019s decentralized applications and tokens. This same phenomenon can be seen with Bitcoin: even though it is slow and expensive, it remains as the largest cryptocurrency due to its name recognition and reputation as the main cryptocurrency. Any Ethereum developers would have to learn an entirely new programming language to develop on Cardano immediately, or wait an indefinite amount of time for tools that let them use Ethereum\u2019s programming language on Cardano. Additionally, anyone who uses popular Ethereum apps like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound will have to learn an entirely new wallet and ecosystem. This may be a huge barrier to adoption for Cardano, and is the reason the vast majority of other \u201cEthereum killers\u201d have failed in their goal.Cardano\u2019s plan to mitigate this threat is by creating partnerships and generating hype around their ecosystem. Unlike the Ethereum Killers who have come before, Cardano already has significant partnerships, such as one with the country of Ethiopia, and seems to also be garnering corporate interest. Another risk with Cardano is Ethereum 2.0, which is slated to release sometime in late 2021 or early 2022. This upgrade will be incredibly monumental and fix the high transaction costs and slow speeds that currently plague the blockchain. Cardano needs to convince both developers and users that its blockchain is good enough to warrant a migration, or build up their own partnerships and user base that would rather use Cardano regardless. Of course, if there is a problem with Ethereum 2.0 or it gets delayed again, Cardano will have more time to build a following. On the other hand, if Cardano\u2019s smart contract release fails to live up to expectations, Ethereum will seize the opportunity to grow its reach even more.Given the recent ADA price action, it is hard to determine whether or not ADA is overvalued. If it is truly capable of competing with Etheruem, both in terms of technology and users, then it is incredibly undervalued at its current price, and could overtake Ethereum in terms of market capitalization. On the other hand, if it succumbs to the problems of other smart contract platforms and fails to create a developer and user ecosystem, it will become a zombie blockchain and not gain any traction. At its current price, it is valued higher than any other Ethereum killer which has come before, which means the market believes it has the most potential to live up to its promise. Nonetheless, only time will tell, and the future of Cardano could very well be decided in the next several months.

Specific wording in the U.S. infrastructure bill would require almost everyone in cryptocurrency, including miners, stakers, wallet creators, and DeFi developers, to perform KYC on their users, which is nearly impossible. Fortunately, there are still many years until this would go into effect, and many opportunities for the legislation to be changed. The United States is beginning a push towards the regulation and taxation of cryptocurrencies in an unorthodox manner. Instead of holding hearings, getting expert opinions, and drafting a bill, politicians snuck crypto legislation into the infrastructure bill, which is a large bill that describes what the United States will spend money on and where the money will come from.The infrastructure bill covers topics like highway and road spending, military spending, and broadband connectivity. In total, these improvements will cost the government $1 trillion and will be paid through taxes. Cryptocurrencies, which up until now have had no tax guidance in the United States, were chosen to be included as a way to generate an estimated $28 billion in tax revenue.The section in the bill reads that brokers of digital assets will need to report tax information, and defines a broker as \u201cany person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person.\u201d The main problem with this sentence is how vague and broad the definition of a broker is. Currently, this could include exchanges, miners, staking delegates, and even hardware wallet manufacturers. For entities like delegates, who only know the address of their delegators and nothing else, this type of law would be impossible to enforce, as it would require the delegate to send tax documents to every single person who delegated their cryptocurrency to them. Not only is this absurd, but also is impossible to properly enforce. It would effectively destroy the cryptocurrency industry in the United States, as nobody would be able to follow the laws and would have to choose between shutting down or going to jail and paying fines.With many high-profile investors and tech giants opposing the bill, like Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, and Mark Cuban, there is a lot of pressure on politicians to change the wording as soon as possible. There were proposed amendments to the bill, namely by Senators Lummis, Toomey, and Wyden, but they were objected to by Senator Shelby, who receives nearly half a million dollars in donations from banks.Even though this bill, which is now officially passed by the Senate, would be devastating for the crypto industry, there is still a long way to go before the bill is officially law. First, the bill has to pass through the House of Representatives, where it will be scrutinized and changed by over 400 politicians. It is likely that someone in the House will want to change the bill to be more accepting of cryptocurrencies, as it would be a massive popularity boost, especially with an election cycle happening next year.Even after the bill passes through the House of Representatives, there is still opportunity for it to be changed over the coming years. This is likely, as the SEC and other regulatory bodies will begin issuing regulation on the cryptocurrency industry in 2022, which will likely overturn or clarify the definition of a broker. The current chairman of the SEC, Gary Gensler, is an MIT blockchain professor, so he should know how unenforceable this law is and that it will need to be changed. Finally, if all else fails, this law will not go into effect until 2023, which would give all crypto companies and entities ample opportunity to work around the legislation or move to different countries entirely. Even though this legislation seems incredibly negative for the cryptocurrency industry, it is likely that something will happen in the next couple of years that will fix the problems of the bill, and the government will take a more crypto-friendly stance. With cryptocurrencies being researched and adopted around the world, the United States will be lagging behind if they do not take initiative to adopt and accept cryptocurrencies, along with the billions of dollars they bring to the country in the form of jobs and taxes.

Though there has been good news recently, such as EIP-1559, there have also been regulatory concerns and issues that should make investors cautious, yet optimistic. During the first part of 2021, when the cryptocurrency market was experiencing a meteoric rise from a $750 billion to a $2.5 trillion valuation, investors were incredibly excited and optimistic about the inevitability of a $100,000 Bitcoin. Unfortunately, since mid-April, the markets have been on a steady decline and fell by nearly 50%, which is over $1 trillion in lost value. This massive correction saw many newcomers into the cryptocurrency space lose a significant portion of their initial investment, even though anyone who invested before 2021 is still in profit territory. Though many speculated that this decrease would be the beginning of a 4-year bear market, this does not appear to be the case. Since Bitcoin fell below $30,000 on July 20th, the markets have begun to rebound, and are now up to a total valuation of $1.7 trillion, up nearly 50% over the past three weeks.Though market corrections are always devastating to individual holders, they are typically beneficial for the overall health of the market. For example, the previous bullrun saw astronomical and undeserved valuations for many meme coins, such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Safemoon. Even after the most recent upturn, some of these meme coins are still down 75% or more from their all-time highs, and will likely never reach new all-time highs. With less scam and meme projects, there is more room for high-quality cryptocurrencies to grow and thrive.The reason for the market increase has been highly speculated, yet there seems to be no true cause. One of the most popular theories is that the recent implementation of EIP-1559, an upgrade to Ethereum, is the cause. This is because this upgrade causes some of the transaction fees from using the Ethereum network to be burned and taken out of the total supply, instead of being distributed to miners. This means that, with enough transaction fees, Ethereum could become deflationary, and any asset with a decreasing supply and fixed demand has an increase in price. Though this is a compelling argument, it does not explain why all cryptocurrencies, not just Ethereum, are increasing. Arguably this upgrade is bad for Bitcoin, as it makes Ethereum closer to becoming a store of value asset like Bitcoin, so Bitcoin should have decreased following its successful implementation. Another theory is that the cryptocurrency whales have stopped manipulating the market and creating sell pressure. They are now creating buying pressure, which will cause their holdings to increase in value, and will promptly sell off some of their crypto when they feel inclined to do so. This is nearly impossible to prove, though in unregulated markets there is always some level of manipulation. If this speculation is correct then the current uptrend is only temporary and will last as long as the whales want it to.Even though an increase in price would suggest entirely positive news, there has been some negative news coming from the United States. In an infrastructure bill being evaluated by Congress, there is a section about taxing cryptocurrencies and crypto industries. Right now, it would require all wallet providers, exchanges, and proof of stake delegates to provide tax documents to their users, which is effectively impossible and would devastate the U.S. crypto industry. Fortunately, there is an amendment proposed by Senators Lummis, Wyden, and Toomey that exempts these entities from the proposed tax requirements, which would be incredibly positive for the market. Typically in times of uncertainty the price stays steady, so it does not make sense that there has been significant upside movement. At the moment, there are more supporters for the amendment than opposers, but it is still far from certain to pass.Though the reason for the market\u2019s increase is uncertain, investors can be cautiously optimistic about future price action. At current prices, many still believe that crypto is undervalued, so this price movement may simply be a correction to the true value of crypto. Regardless of what the cause is, there is news to both be celebrated and feared in the space, so investors need to use diligence and rational thinking now more than ever when choosing their next move.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3550355","Time":1628436122,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.054,"neu":0.843,"pos":0.102,"compound":0.9832,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.4916},"16":{"Title":"What is Efinity, the New NFT Blockchain from the team behind Enjin Coin","Content":"Enjin, the team behind the multi-billion dollar Enjin Coin, has recently released their new project, Efinity. Built with Polkadot technology, it aims to be a next-generation blockchain for NFTs and offer fast finality, low fees, and incentives for ENJ holders. The biggest problem stopping NFTs from reaching mainstream adoption is the high fees and slow transaction times associated with Etheruem. Buying an NFT can cost upwards of $100 in fees, and also requires that a user hold ETH and be tech-savvy enough to set up a MetaMask wallet funded in Ethereum. All of these barriers to entry prevent the average person from buying and interacting with NFTs.Enjin, a software company that initially focused on the video game Minecraft, created Enjin Coin in 2017 as a way to back NFTs by a tangible asset, thus giving them a value floor. They also created the ERC-1155 token standard, which allows for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens in the same contract, saving on gas fees and offering more developer flexibility. However, none of this was enough to combat the inherent problems of the Ethereum blockchain. Additionally, there was the problem of incompatibility between NFT ecosystems, meaning that marketplaces were segmented and incapable of interacting with one another. Efinity was created to be a cross-chain NFT blockchain, which will allow interoperability between ecosystems, rewards for those who interact with NFTs, and a seamless user experience. The Efinity blockchain will run as a parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem. This means that Efinity will be one of one hundred blockchains that are able to interact with one another through Polkadot\u2019s interoperability technology, which will allow developers of other parachains to integrate Efinity NFTs into their ecosystem and know that they will also work in other blockchains. Furthermore, Enjin is creating the paratoken, which will be similar to the ERC-1155 tokens that they created for Ethereum. In fact, EFI will be the first paratoken. The Efinity blockchain will be able to handle around 700 transactions per second with a confirmation time of six seconds. Efinity will also have a native marketplace, where users can mint, buy, and sell NFTs. Even though this new coin may seem like a slight to ENJ holders, it actually increases the value proposition of Enjin\u2019s original coin. ENJ can now be staked in order to receive EFI, and any ENJ that is inside NFTs will also automatically be staked and earn rewards. This will allow ENJ holders to reap the benefits of this new blockchain without ever directly buying EFI. The Efinity token was initially made available in a CoinList sale, where it was sold for 20 cents. Now, the coin is hovering around $1, and seems to have stabilized at this price point. It has a current circulating supply of 54 million, and a total supply of 2 billion. This gives the EFI token a current market capitalization of $43 million, or $1.5 billion of the total supply is counted. EFI will be used to pay fees on the network, and all fees for buying and selling NFTs will be redistributed to EFI holders. It will also be used for decentralized governance of the blockchain.A unique feature of the Efinity ecosystem is that it rewards all actors in the network, not just validators. For example, users will be able to earn EFI by bidding on NFTs, regardless of whether or not they win the auction.Enjin is also creating JumpNet, an Ethereum scaling solution that allows for free NFT and ENJ transactions. They plan to create a bridge between Ethereum, JumpNet, and Efinity to facilitate interoperable NFTs. There is a limit to the number of transactions a user can make, and holding EFI increases these limits, bringing more use to the token.The Efinity project has lofty goals, and could help bring NFTs to millions of users who currently cannot access the technology due to high barriers to entry. The Efinity project is still not ready for a full release, as they still have to develop the technology and connect to Polkadot. At the moment, the EFI token lives on the Ethereum blockchain, but will eventually be ported to its own blockchain once the Efinity mainnet goes live. Though the technology may not be ready for a while, the fact that Enjin has a good record of delivering on their promises has the blockchain community excited about the potential for Efinity and its next-generation technology.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3546203","Time":1628241665,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.026,"neu":0.894,"pos":0.08,"compound":0.9785,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.48925},"17":{"Title":"MMA and Blockchain: The Perfect Duo","Content":"Mixed Martial Arts, or MMA, is one of the fastest growing sports in the world and has been consistently evolving to create a wider sphere of influence. Similarly, blockchain technology promises to revolutionize the internet and be the next big thing in the world of technology. Together, these two fields have been building off of one another to grow their influence, like through the partnership between NFT marketplace Unique hash and MMA management agency Dodge Sports.MMA is one of the oldest sports in existence, and is rumored to have been played as early as the Olympics in 648 BC. However, it has only recently begun to increase in popularity around the world, and was catalyzed by the creation of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, or UFC, in 1993. The UFC UFC's inception and subsequent coordination with state athletic commissions helped to regulate the sport and turn it into a mainstream commodity.The sport has grown rapidly since its inception, and every UFC pay-per-view event now receives millions of viewers from around the world. When the UFC was first sold in 2001, it went for $2 million. Now, only 20 years later, it is worth an estimated $10 billion, making it one of the most valuable sports promotions in the world. Other promotions, such as ONE Championship and Bellator, are also worth hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. In fact, Bellator is owned by ViacomCBS, one of the largest media companies in the world. A lot of MMA\u2019s growth can be attributed to its constant adaptation and evolution in order to cater to fans, such as a large and highly engaging social media presence, lucrative sponsorship deals, and the celebrity status of top fighters like Connor McGregor.With its adaptable and ever-expanding nature, it was inevitable that the MMA world would mix with blockchain technology, which has also been expanding rapidly over the last decade and quickly becoming a household name. MMA and blockchain are beginning to become intertwined, as they are both fast-growing and exciting fields that are only beginning to be understood by the general public. In early July 2021, the link between blockchain and MMA became even closer, as the UFC and Crypto.com announced a record-breaking $175 million sponsorship deal. For the next 10 years, cryptocurrency exchange and wallet provider Crypto.com will have their logo on the walls and floors of the Octagon, which is where the fighters battle, and the shirts and shorts of the fighters. This deal will help bring mainstream awareness to Crypto.com, and help cryptocurrencies grow alongside the UFC and MMA.Crypto.com is the first and only non-outfitting entity to have their logo on the standard UFC fight kit (uniform). Only Reebok and Venum (the UFC's only two outfitters) have had that spot so far.Unique hash (https:\/\/uniquehash.com), the new NFT marketplace aimed at bringing everyday people into the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, recently announced a partnership with Dodge Sports, a top UFC and MMA athlete-representation agency based out of Miami. All 16 of Dodge Sports\u2019 clients, along with a special logo NFT, were minted on the Unique hash platform and are now on sale. Each comes with a special reward, such as a swag box or a shoutout from a fighter, that is only revealed after purchasing the NFT. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most prominent fighters under Dodge Sports and the designs for their NFTs.Andre \u2018Daii\u2019 Ewell is a fighter in the UFC from California. He fights in the bantamweight division, which groups fighters in the 126-135lb weight class, and is 5 feet 11 inches tall. His professional win-loss record is 17-8, and he has won championship titles outside the UFC. His positivity, lightheartedness, and social media antics make him a fan favorite, which is why many believe his NFT will not be on sale for long. Jesse Taylor is another popular fighter now immortalized as an NFT in the Dodge Sports + Unique hash Collection. He is a former winner of Ultimate Fighter, a popular reality TV show where elite MMA fighters compete against one another for the grand prize, a six-figure contract to fight in the UFC. He has 31 wins and 16 losses in his professional career, and has fought in multiple different weight classes. He has fought in multiple different promotions, including the Maximum Fighting Championship, World Series of Fighting, and Cage Warriors Fighting Championship \u2014 the promotion Conor McGregor fought in before joining the UFC roster. In his long career, he has been the Cage Warriors middleweight champion, Total Combat middleweight champion, and the King of Champions middleweight champion. He is an exciting and engaging fighter to watch, and has an impressive social media following of over 60,000 followers on Instagram.Aaron Jeffery is an exciting young prospect in the MMA scene. At 28 years old, 6 feet 2 inches, and 185 pounds, he fights in the middleweight weight class. On September 28, Jeffery, who is currently 10-2 and holds the Cage Fury FC middleweight title, will be fighting Caio Borralho in Dana White\u2019s Contender Series. This is one of the most exciting events in MMA, because Dana White, who is the president of the UFC, uses this event as a way to scout potential talent for the UFC. If Jeffery has a great performance in this event, and is chosen by White to be the next fighter in the world\u2019s biggest MMA promotion, his NFT might be seen as more valuable to collectors. These three fighters, along with the 13 others managed by Dodge Sports, represent some of the top talent in the MMA scene. Their immortalization as NFTs is a keystone event in both the blockchain and MMA world, as it marks the beginning of the digitalization of fighters and the link between the MMA and blockchain.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3544904","Time":1628184490,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.048,"neu":0.799,"pos":0.153,"compound":0.9987,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.575,"pos_right":0.425,"compound_right":0.5719,"Total Score":0.93468},"18":{"Title":"How to Buy, Sell, and Mint NFTs for Free on Unique hash, the World\u2019s Newest NFT Marketplace","Content":"Unique hash (https:\/\/uniquehash.com), a revolutionary marketplace where users can discover, trade, and create non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, was recently released. Let\u2019s take a look at how anyone can use Unique hash to either create their own NFT or buy an NFT artwork on the platform with 0 fees for a limited time.Unique hash is bringing the billion-dollar art world to the blockchain sector. Current NFT marketplaces are niche platforms within the cryptocurrency community, while Unique hash is focusing on bringing artists and users outside of the blockchain space to their platform, while also charging no fees. Here is a tutorial about how to get started with Unique hash and join the NFT revolution.Step 1: Install the MetaMask ExtensionMetaMask is an extension available on all computers that allows web browsers to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. When you install MetaMask, you will be asked to go through a setup process, where you will be creating a new Ethereum wallet. A link to MetaMask can be found here. While going through the process, you will be asked to create a password and write down a 24-word seed phrase. This seed phrase is crucial, as it is the main password for your Etheruem wallet. If you lose the seed phrase, or a hacker steals it, they will be able to steal all of your funds. The most secure way to store a seed phrase is by writing it down on a piece of paper, and not storing it on your computer. Once you finish the setup process, you will be greeted with a screen that looks like this:Step 2: Fund your MetaMask account with EthereumGreat work setting up your MetaMask account, that is the hardest step. Now, using your favorite cryptocurrency exchange, buy Ethereum (ETH), which will be used to buy, sell, and mint NFTs on Unique hash. Some of the most popular exchanges include Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken, and these can be found on the App Store as well as by Googling their names. Once you buy your desired amount of ETH, we are going to withdraw it to your MetaMask account. On the balance page of your exchange, there should be a button that says \u201cwithdraw.\u201d Choose to withdraw to an Ethereum address. Now, go back to your MetaMask, and look at the diagram below. Click on the circled area, which should copy your Ethereum address to your clipboard. Now, paste this address into the exchange\u2019s withdrawal page, and double check that the address you are withdrawing to is the same as the address on your MetaMask screen. Once you confirm this, confirm your withdrawal and wait about 5-10 minutes for the Ethereum to show up in your MetaMask screen.Step 3: Log into Unique hash Using MetaMaskNow, you are ready to use the Unique hash platform. Go to unique hash.com, which should take you to the homepage where you can see NFTs for sale. In the top right, there is a black button that says \u201cconnect wallet.\u201d Click on this, and your MetaMask should open up, and confirm that you want to connect to Unique hash. Step 4: Bid on your Favorite NFTsNow, you can buy any NFT you like on the Unique hash platform. All NFTs are put up for auction, so you must bid on the NFTs you like. To see a full list of NFTs up for auction, there are two places you can check. To look at NFTs that already have a bid and whose auctions will end in less than 24 hours, look at the Live Auctions tab on the home page. For artworks that have not received a bid yet, look at the Featured Artworks tab. Once you find an NFT worth bidding on, such as the Dodge Sports Genesis NFT, click on the artwork, and place your bid. Once you confirm the bid in MetaMask, you are done, and can come back at any time to ensure that you are still the highest bidder.Step 5: Create and Mint NFTsNow that you are an expert in buying NFTs, let\u2019s learn how to mint your own! On the home page, click the \u201cCreate Items\u201d button. This will take you to a page that looks like this: From here, click on \u201cMy Items\u201d on the left side of the screen. Then, in the top right, below your address, click the \u201cCreate Items\u201d button. Now, you can upload any image or artwork you like, and give it a title, description, and link if appropriate. This item will now appear under the \u201cMy Items'' page. In order to permanently mint this to the Etheruem blockchain and put it up for auction on Unique hash, scroll over on the item until you reach the \u201cStart the auction\u201d button. Click on this, and enter the starting price from the item. Once you click submit, your MetaMask will open up and ask you to confirm your listing. This costs around $10, due to the current high fees on Ethereum. Unique hash is looking into ways to solve this issue, but for now the fee is required to mint the NFT. After confirming the listing, your NFT will be listed on Unique hash, and millions of buyers around the world will be able to bid on your NFT! Congratulations! Unique hash offers a simple and convenient way for anyone to buy, sell, and create NFTs. Our mission is to bring as many users as possible to the NFT space so they can see the convenience and simplicity that this new form of art offers, which is why anyone can mint and buy NFTs without fees for a limited time. Thank you for joining us on this journey, and we hope to see you buying and minting on our platform soon.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3541915","Time":1628065347,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.012,"neu":0.926,"pos":0.062,"compound":0.9857,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.829,"pos_right":0.171,"compound_right":0.5106,"Total Score":0.914435},"19":{"Title":"Cryptocurrency Companies are Being Scrutinized and Banned by Regulators. Why is this Happening and Will it Continue","Content":"Recently, cryptocurrency companies have been under fire from regulators around the world. For example, Binance has been banned by the United Kingdom and Malaysa, and BlockFi is banned in multiple U.S. states, and all exchanges are banned in China. This is due to the growing regulatory concerns around cryptocurrencies as well as lobbying by banks, both of which should subside as cryptocurrencies become more mature.Around the world, the main focus of media covering regulation seems to be on the regulation of cryptocurrencies. However, many fail to notice that cryptocurrency-related companies have also come under scrutiny from top world governments, and have been accused of selling unregistered securities, among other crimes. Without these companies, which bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance, investors around the world would have significant difficulty investing in the cryptocurrency market. Arguably, this makes the effective regulation of crypto businesses even more important than cryptocurrencies themselves.Unfortunately, companies have been facing an increasingly uphill battle against regulators and banks. Countries have been banning the Binance exchange, citing regulatory concerns and the growing threat of money laundering and cyberattacks. Furthermore, in the United States, the cryptocurrency lending platform BlockFi has been banned from many states, including Kentucky, New York, Texas, and New Jersey. Even though this trend is threatening, and does not bode well for the future of cryptocurrencies, both companies are fighting against their bans, and have ample proof to do so. The states that are banning BlockFi are giving the company, which is planning to go public in 2022, the chance to respond and prove that they are not selling unlicensed securities. In all likelihood, these bans are simply the effect of states who do not know how to regulate cryptocurrencies taking an overly-strict approach to start, before slowly rolling back their bans as they begin to understand more about blockchain technology. BlockFi is ensuring their clients and investors that they are not breaking any securities laws and that they will continue to operate as normal. As a New York-based financial services company, BlockFi is subject to some of the most stringent regulations in the country, and should be easily able to meet the financial requirements of other states. Additionally, the fact that BlockFi is continuing to raise money in their Series E investment round is reassuring, as venture capital firms are betting that BlockFi is a legitimate company that will one day be listed as a public company on the U.S. stock exchange. Banks around the world are somewhat responsible for putting pressure on regulators to take action against cryptocurrency companies. For example, Brad Sherman, one of the most anti-crypto politicians in the United States, receives $100,000 from banks and exchanges yearly, which suggests that he is acting in the banks\u2019 best interests in order to continue receiving their donations. In most cases, the companies on the wrong side of emerging technology either have to adapt or go out of business. Some banks have been adapting to crypto, like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, while others simply refuse to acknowledge it. The ones that refuse to accept that blockchain technology will bring changes to the financial system will be left behind, no matter how much they push for regulations on their competitors. In all likelihood, the regulatory concerns with cryptocurrency companies will be sorted out within the next couple of years. Due to blockchain\u2019s continued growth and maturity around the world, the United States will be pressured to be more lenient in regulations, to ensure that its citizens can continue being at the forefront of technology and a world leader in blockchain. Though the recent push in regulations for cryptocurrency companies appears threatening to the cryptocurrency market, it will likely subside over the coming years. The cryptocurrency market is still a Wild West, and regulation must be made in order to bring blockchain and cryptocurrency to the masses. If regulation is strict and companies like BlockFi are barred from operating in the United States, it will be extremely negative for crypto. However, it is much more likely that banks begin to accept cryptocurrencies more, let off the pressure they are putting on Congress, and that effective regulation is created.

Though all of this news may appear to be completely negative, it is unlikely that the United States will completely ban crypto, and only the most blatant offenders will have action taken against them.The United States is known for having strict laws and regulations in place to protect investors. For the past 13 years, cryptocurrencies have operated outside of these guidelines, and have been available for anyone to buy, sell, or exchange without any regulatory concern. Unfortunately, this appears to be changing, as top U.S. financial officials such as Securities and Exchange Chairman Gary Gensler, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and Congressman Brad Sherman have been calling for regulation in the cryptocurrency space.There are a few specific areas that regulators have been heavily targeting in their first push towards the regulation of the cryptocurrency space. The main point of focus is managing the unregistered securities that are being freely exchanged on cryptocurrency markets. A security, by U.S. definition, is an asset that is an \"investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.\u201d If these four criteria are met by an asset, the government classifies it as a security, which means that it can only trade on registered exchanges such as the NASDAQ and New York Stock Exchange, and anyone who holds the asset must go through stringent KYC\/AML procedures before exchanging it.As one can imagine, any cryptocurrencies that are declared to be securities are likely to be devastated and forgotten, as they would be delisted from all major cryptocurrency exchanges. Right now, XRP, once the third largest crypto by market capitalization, is in a lawsuit with the SEC, who argues that XRP is an unregistered security and needs to be regulated. Fortunately, XRP is winning the lawsuit, and it appears that they will settle and not face any major damages. This will set a strong precedent for all other cryptocurrencies, and the SEC will have to ensure that they now only go after cryptocurrencies that are most definitely securities. It is likely that the vast majority of cryptocurrencies are not securities. In fact, Bitcoin and Ethereum have already been officially declared not securities. They, along with most other cryptocurrencies, are treated as property for the purpose of taxes. Hopefully the SEC will offer greater regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies, making them more usable for purchases. Any time someone buys something using Bitcoin, they have to report the transaction as a taxable event, which is a hassle that is not experienced with cash. If the SEC creates a new asset class known as \u201cdigital currency,\u201d then investors would be able to not only speculate on Bitcoin but also use it as the digital cash it was intended to be.A category of cryptocurrencies that are likely to be declared securities are the exchange tokens, such as Binance\u2019s BNB and FTX\u2019s FTT. These tokens are heavily reliant on their parent companies for their value, and thus it could be argued that they are securities that derive their value from the success of their parent exchange. Binance, for example, dedicates some of their quarterly profits to a buyback of the BNB token, and also creates a use case for BNB by giving users a fee discount when they use it to trade on the platform. Without Binance, what is the use of Binance Coin? This is the question regulators will be asking, and will influence their decision about whether or not BNB and other exchange tokens are securities. Another target area for regulators are stablecoins, specifically those not fully backed by dollars. Banks, which lobby heavily in Congress, have been asking for regulation on stablecoins. This is likely due to the potential for stablecoins and DeFi to replace banks, and Congress is listening to their pleas. They are specifically targeting Tether, which has been scrutinized in the past for their lack of true 1:1 backing for USDT. They only hold enough money to back 77% of the USDT in circulation, which means that it is not truly a coin pegged to the dollar.In all likelihood, regulators will require stablecoin issuers to be more transparent and have full backing of their stablecoins. It is possible, yet unlikely, that stablecoins are banned entirely or declared as securities. In the best case scenario, stablecoins that are fully backed will be declared as currency, which would create less taxable events when they are exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or used in DeFi. Decentralized stablecoins such as DAI have a more uncertain future, as there is no company to sue or server to shut down. Even though they are overcollateralized by a basket of cryptocurrencies, the SEC may not find this sufficient. However, there is nothing they can do to stop DAI from circulating, as it is completely decentralized and not controlled by any one entity. Stopping DAI would be as difficult as stopping the entire Ethereum blockchain.Tokenized stocks are incredibly likely to be regulated by the SEC. These tokens are assets that are pegged to the price of a stock, typically through the use of a decentralized oracle like Chainlink. They offer numerous benefits over traditional stocks, such as being available to anyone, anywhere in the world, and not just United States citizens with bank accounts. Binance used to offer tokenized stocks on their platform, but recently removed them to avoid regulatory scrutiny. Mirror Protocol is a decentralized platform that allows for the issuance of tokenized stocks, similar to how Maker issues DAI as a stablecoin. Even though Mirror is issuing unregistered securities, just like DAI, it would be impossible to stop without shutting down entire decentralized and immutable blockchains, making it unlikely that any regulation will be helpful. Even though the impending cryptocurrency regulation may be devastating for a select few projects, the majority of the market will remain unimpacted. If the regulation is lighter than investors expect, some projects could even see a boost in valuation, as regulation would be one less obstacle in the way of the project\u2019s success. Cryptocurrencies have survived for 13 years through multiple bear markets and crashes, so some overdue regulation will not ruin the $1.6 trillion market.

Even though they appear to be competitors at first, they both serve a unique purpose in the cryptocurrency space, and may be able to coexist, similar to Visa and Mastercard in the credit card industry.Interoperability, the capability for blockchains to interact with one another, is one of the most exciting and promising developments in the cryptocurrency space. Right now, there is no way for Bitcoin, for example, to interact with any other blockchain, like Ethereum. This means that there are trillions of dollars that are unable to join the decentralized finance revolution, and that different blockchains cannot leverage one another to create truly decentralized and trustless applications.Polkadot and Cosmos are two of the biggest projects aiming to fix this problem by creating an internet of blockchains. In most cases, two projects with a similar goal would be competing against each other, and only one would eventually reign supreme. However, these two projects take completely different approaches to achieving interoperability and serve different markets, meaning that they may both survive and thrive together. Let\u2019s take a look at both of these projects and analyze their similarities, differences, and role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem to determine how likely it is that they will coexist in the next generation of the internet. Polkadot was released in May 2020 after multiple years of development and leadership from Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood. They call themselves \u201ca platform for Web3,\u201d and want to enable the next generation of the web where users are in control of their identity and there are no centralized servers or networks. To achieve interoperability while also ensuring that each blockchain is independent and sovereign, Polkadot leverages a method involving two different types of blockchains: parachains and a relay chain. The relay chain is the main polkadot blockchain and has DOT as its native asset, which is used for governance and staking. The parachains are blockchains that are able to seamlessly connect with the relay chain, and each blockchain has its own governance, coin, and other typical features of an independent chain. By connecting to the relay chain, coins from one parachain can be sent to another seamlessly, which enables interoperability between many different chains. Polkadot only supports 100 different parachains, which means that parachains are a scarce resource and projects must bid to acquire one through a process known as a Parachain Loan Auction, or PLO. You can read more about PLOs here. Although this limit does create value for DOT, it also hinders the growth of Polkadot as a complete solution, as it will not be able to connect with every blockchain in existence. Furthermore, for blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum that are already established and will not go through the PLO, Polkadot is creating a bridge that would allow these chains to still be able to interact with the rest of Polkadot. Cosmos was released in 2019 by the software company Tendermint. Before creating Cosmos, Tendermint released a consensus mechanism, also called Tendermint, that simplified the process of creating a blockchain. Before Tendermint was created, building a blockchain was a highly complex process that involved lots of steps, including creating a consensus mechanism and having a network of computers ready to act as validators. Tendermint simplified this process by removing the need to develop consensus methods and networks, and allows developers to focus solely on application development. Tendermint is capable of handling hundreds of transactions per second at low fees, and offers instant finality on transactions, meaning there is no need to wait for a certain number of confirmations. Tendermint, along with the Cosmos Software Development Kit, has been incredibly popular and is used by projects like the Binance Smart Chain, Crypto.com, Terra, and Kava. Cosmos and its ATOM token aim to create a hub where all Tendermint blockchains can be interoperable with one another. This is similar to Polkadot\u2019s relay chain, but only for Tendermint blockchains.Much like Polkadot, Cosmos is also building bridges to non-Tendermint blockchains so coins like ETH and BTC can be freely traded in the Cosmos Hub. Since Parachains are not compatible with Cosmos, and Tendermint chains are not compatible with Polkadot, these two projects will be serving completely different markets, even though their goals are similar. Their only area of overlap is in their support of blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum.In the future, both protocols may work together to create a Cosmos-Polkadot bridge, which would create a fully interoperable ecosystem with many of the biggest blockchains. This would be highly complex and would likely not happen for a couple more years, but is most likely planned by both projects. Even though Polkadot and Cosmos appear to be competitors at first glance, greater inspection leads to the conclusion that they serve different areas of the market. Each will act as a hub for interoperability with a unique set of chains, and both may one day work together to bring full interoperability to the cryptocurrency ecosystem.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3536877","Time":1627845391,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.012,"neu":0.896,"pos":0.091,"compound":0.9938,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.4969},"22":{"Title":"What are the Most Promising Ethereum Alternatives? Part 2","Content":"Previously, we analyzed some of the high market capitalization smart contract blockchains that could overtake Ethereum as the king of the smart contract platforms. Today, we are going to continue this discussion and analysis by looking at some smart contract platforms in the 40-100 range in terms of market capitalization. There is an important reason to discuss the different smart contract platforms in terms of both technology and market capitalization. No matter how good a smart contract blockchain\u2019s technology is, if it has no users then it is completely worthless. By looking at the market capitalization of each project, it is easier to determine which projects investors and developers are excited about, and thus these cryptocurrencies are more likely to stand a chance of overtaking Ethereum. Today, the smart contract platforms we will be discussing are medium-cap coins. If they grow to reach the size of Ethereum, then investors could see 100x returns, but there is more risk involved and they may never grow to that size. Tezos is an interesting project in the smart contract space whose unique feature is their governance system. In blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin, a hard fork can occur, which is what happens when miners disagree about something, like the validity of a certain transaction or the rules of the protocol. This is what happened in 2017 when Bitcoin Cash split off from Bitcoin. Tezos has a governance system built-into the protocol itself, which prevents hard forks while also giving each XTZ holder a say in how the protocol will evolve over time. The flexibility and upgradability of Tezos gives it the opportunity to continuously evolve and adapt to any new technologies, thus making it safe from any sort of obsolescence. Recently, the main focus of Tezos has been their NFTs, which are more environmentally friendly than those on Ethereum due to Tezos being proof of stake instead of proof of work. There are around 100 decentralized applications building on Tezos, and they have partnerships with Redbull, Ubisoft, and others. Much like any smart contract platform, their main concern is onboarding more users and developers.Stacks is a blockchain that is bringing smart contracts to the Bitcoin blockchain. This allows for smart contracts to be created that inherit the security, capital, and network effects of Bitcoin. Their native token, STX, is used to help secure the network, in a consensus model known as proof of transfer. Basically, the Stacks blockchain is where the storage of smart contracts and their transactions takes place, and the Bitcoin blockchain is where transactions are finalized. This means that Stacks is not bottlenecked by Bitcoin\u2019s low number of transactions per second, and could theoretically scale to thousands of transactions per second, all while having the security guarantees of Bitcoin. The STX token was sold in a regulated sale that was approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, meaning it is classified as a security. This has made U.S. exchanges wary of listing the coin, and it has not had a huge presence in the United States. The idea of Bitcoin being the main blockchain for both store of value and smart contracts is enticing, especially for Bitcoin maximalists.NEAR Protocol is a blockchain focused on creating an easy user and developer experience. In order to achieve high transaction throughput, NEAR uses a technology known as sharding. In a sharding system, different validators process different transactions, and work in parallel to confirm multiple transactions at once. This is different from Ethereum, where every validator is focusing on validating the same transaction in a linear fashion. One of the features NEAR has implemented to make it more user friendly is human-readable addresses, instead of the long strings of letters and numbers used on other blockchains. They also allow for users to interact with the blockchain without having a wallet, which makes it ideal for users who are used to creating a Google account, but would have no idea about how to create a MetaMask account. NEAR has flown under the radar of most cryptocurrency investors due to their dedication to development rather than marketing.Flow is a smart contact platform created by the team behind CryptoKitties, the original NFT project from 2018. After their dApp congested the Ethereum network and brought fees to never-before-seen highs, the CryptoKitties team knew they needed to find a better solution that would offer low fees and high transaction times. As a result, they created Flow, which promises to solve these issues by using a consensus model that has different validators focus on different parts of consensus. For example, high-powered computers do the intensive execution work, while weaker nodes can validate transactions. Flow\u2019s biggest strength is their partnerships and user interface. They are the blockchain that NBA Top Shot, one of the biggest NFT marketplaces, is based on. NBA Top Shot has debit card integration so users do not need to buy Flow before using the blockchain. They also have partnerships with the UFC, Warner Music Group, and Ubisoft, all of which are planning to release NFTs on the Flow blockchain. With these big name brands, Flow is bringing mainstream users to the blockchain space, which is why it could shoot up in the rankings and become one of the top smart contract and NFT platforms. Harmony is the 83rd largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, but its technology makes it worthy of a spot in the top 50. Harmony was the first blockchain to implement sharding technology, which allows for high scalability and upgradability. With four shards, the Harmony blockchain can process over 2,000 transactions per second. The team\u2019s goal is to have 2,000 shards, which would give an estimated 1 million transactions per second. Though all of these blockchains have great technology and development teams, all of them but Flow currently lack users. They all have a small number of decentralized applications, but are actively incentivizing developers to build on their platforms. Though it is far from a guarantee, if any of these blockchains catch the eye of the general public, holders of that blockchain\u2019s coin will see massive gains.It remains to be seen if any coin covered will be a true Ethereum killer. However, these are some of the most promising picks of the cryptocurrency space, and whether or not they become the biggest smart contract platform, their technology is sure to be adopted and improved upon by the next generation of blockchain platforms.

Part 1","Content":"Even though Ethereum is the current king of smart contracts, anything can happen in the future. If an exploit is found or Ethereum 2.0 gets continuously delayed, there may be another smart contract platform that overtakes Ethereum. Ever since its release in 2015, Ethereum has been the dominant blockchain-based smart contract platform. For those who are unaware, smart contracts are contracts where the terms of agreement are written in code and executed automatically, compared to traditional contracts which are written and enforced by law. They are responsible for a massive share of the cryptocurrency market, and many of the largest projects in the space would not be around if not for these contracts. For example, every DeFi app, token, and NFT has been created using a smart contract. Being the main smart contract platform brings lots of attention and users to Ethereum, which is why it has a valuation over $200 billion and is known as the \"king of the smart contract platforms.\"However, Ethereum is not guaranteed to keep this title in the future. Ethereum is still a new technology, and is prone to bugs, exploits, and other unforeseen events. Furthermore, the Ethereum blockchain is currently slow and expensive, and it has competitors that are much faster and cheaper. If Ethereum developers are unable to deliver on their promise to fix its scaling issues, it would likely fade into obscurity as better alternatives sprang forward.It is easy to see why the lucrative and revolutionary sector of smart contracts would entice other projects to begin building their own platforms and protocols to compete with Ethereum. In fact, there are over thirty three smart contract platforms in the top 100 cryptocurrencies, and even more in the lower rankings. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most promising smart contract platforms, what they offer, and how they could compete or collaborate with Ethereum.Cardano is the second largest smart contract platform behind Ethereum. It was created in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson, an Ethereum co-founder, as an \u201cEthereum killer.\u201d It uses a proof of stake consensus model and offers users 5-7% APR through staking ADA, the native asset of the Cardano blockchain. Cardano has taken a scientific and peer-reviewed approach to their technology, and thus has made much slower progress than their competitors. In fact, they have yet to enable smart contract functionality on the Cardano blockchain, and it is currently only able to send and receive ADA transactions. However, this will change in Fall 2021. Additionally, Cardano can currently handle 50 transactions per second, compared to Ethereum\u2019s 14, and plans to scale to up to 2 million transactions per second through a scaling solution known as Hydra. They also have some significant partnerships, and their biggest is with the Ethopian government. Even though they technically do not have any dApps or tokens on their blockchain yet, they are one of the biggest and hyped cryptocurrency projects and are bound to garner developer attention after they roll out smart contract functionality. Solana is a relatively new smart contract platform that emphasizes speed as its main feature. As of today, the Solana blockchain can handle 50,000 transactions per second, which easily makes it the fastest smart contract platform. Since the project is relatively new, there is not a large ecosystem of decentralized applications building on Solana, but that is poised to change in the near future. In a recent fundraising round, Solana raised $300 million dollars from venture capital firms that will be used to grow their ecosystem and incentivize developers to use their platform. Additionally, Solana is partnered with FTX, one of the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. FTX chose Solana as the blockchain that they will use to build their Serum decentralized exchange, which could have faster settlement times than the NASDAQ. As expected, Solana\u2019s speed does come at a cost. It is relatively centralized compared to other smart contract platforms, and running a node requires specialized and expensive hardware. The team is looking into fixing this issue, but it is much easier to look into something than it is to actually fix it.Some projects are taking a dual blockchain approach and choose to see Solana as an Ethereum complement. For example, Audius runs their decentralized application on Solana to take advantage of high speeds and low transaction costs, while using Ethereum for their AUDIO token to have security and stability.Algorand, one of the most talked about cryptocurrencies on the cryptocurrency subreddit, is also a competitor in the smart contract platform space. It was created by Silvio Micali, a blockchain professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 2019. It was originally created to solve the scalability trilemma, which is the idea that a blockchain cannot be scalable, secure, and decentralized. Through their pure proof of stake consensus model, Algorand attempts to solve this problem by having over one thousand validator nodes while also achieving over 1,000 transactions per second.Much like many new blockchains, it has yet to see many developers use their platform to build dApps. However, many speculate that Algorand will be the blockchain of choice for Central Bank Digital Currencies, or CBDCs. If this is true, and a large government like the United States uses Algorand\u2019s technology for their digital currency, the blockchain is bound to receive more attention and popularity. Even though these are some of the potential coins that can overtake Ethereum, there are many more that are worthy of consideration. Keep an eye out for Part 2 of this series, where Near Protocol, Harmony, Tezos, and more will be analyzed!By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3524726","Time":1627198914,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.017,"neu":0.872,"pos":0.111,"compound":0.9973,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.7,"pos_right":0.3,"compound_right":0.4576,"Total Score":0.916345},"25":{"Title":"What is the Best Way to Invest During a Cryptocurrency Bear Market","Content":"Cryptocurrency bear markets are some of the worst times for investors, as they are filled with uncertainty and declining profits. In order to reduce losses during these periods, which can last upwards of two years, dollar cost averaging over the long term, investing without emotion, and creating a sell plan are some of the steps that investors can take.In both traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies, bear markets are the enemy of investors. They signal a time when the prices of assets continually decrease with no end in sight. As soon as investors begin to think prices are at their lowest, they drop another 10%, which is demoralizing and leads to a significant loss in profits. Recently, the cryptocurrency market has entered a bear market, which is signified by the fact that the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is down around 50% from its all-time high. Meme cryptocurrencies and high-inflation DeFi coins, such as Dogecoin and Pancakeswap, have decreased in price by around 70%, and more promising coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum are down 50%.Not only has this bear market been bad for the price of assets, but also for the popularity of cryptocurrencies. Retail investors, who were once scrambling to buy as many NFTs and Dogecoins as possible, have since sold their holdings and moved into other assets, like commodities or the stock market. This means that those left in crypto now are the true believers in the space, and are not interested in meme coins or chasing 1000% yields on unsound tokens.During these uncertain times, it is important for investors to have a plan and exercise caution in order to not lose all of their money. Let\u2019s look at a couple tips that will help investors with preserving their capital during a cryptocurrency bear market.First, investors should practice more due diligence when choosing what coins to buy. In a bull market, almost every cryptocurrency breaks its all-time high and sees 100% to 500% gains. In a bear market, only the strongest projects survive, and many projects never recover due to a bad product, unmotivated team, or general lack of interest. For example, only five of the top 25 coins from the end of 2017 hit a new all-time high in the bull market of 2021, and the rest of the coins either fell out of the top 100 or are somewhere in the top 50. Thus, it is crucial to only back projects that have lots of potential, real-world use cases, developer interest, and institutional interest. Arguably, interest from institutions and venture capital firms is most important, as if an investment is good enough for a firm with hundreds of dedicated researchers and investors, it should be good enough for the average person. Nonetheless, individual research and diligence should be done with every new cryptocurrency an investor is considering adding to their portfolio.Due diligence should also be done on the projects currently in an investor\u2019s portfolio. Even though a coin may have performed well during this bull market, there is no guarantee it will hold up until the next one. As a result, investors should closely evaluate the projects they are currently holding and see if there are any that should be sold. Even though the price may be down from its all-time high, a bad project\u2019s valuation will only decrease over time, and the 70% loss may turn into a 90% loss.When buying and selling cryptocurrencies, investors need to act without emotion, which is another critical trait of a strong investor. Even though there may be tens of thousands of dollars on the line, investors need to be strong in their beliefs, and not buy purely based on the fear of missing out, also known as FOMO. Furthermore, investors also need to be emotionless during price declines. If an investor did their due diligence and knows that a project is solid, then a price decrease should be seen as an opportunity to buy at a discount, not the loss of capital. Any investors that use emotion as their primary investing tool will always be buying high and selling low. One of the most common emotions felt during a bull market is greed. For most investors, bear markets are euphoric, and everyone feels like they are a genius investor. The thought that the markets will eventually decline seems crazy, and $1 million Bitcoin seems to be in sight. However, for the investors who do not invest with emotion, this is not the case, and they know that every market eventually corrects downwards.If investors have chosen projects they believe in, and still want to invest more during the downturn, the best way to do so is with a dollar cost average, or DCA, strategy. This strategy involves buying a set amount of crypto every certain number of days, typically every seven days. This ensures that no matter what happens in the market in the short term, investors are able to consistently buy crypto at an average weekly cost. Furthermore, it prevents people from \u201cbuying the dip\u201d at Bitcoin when it is $50,000, then having no money left to buy at $30,000. Serious investors should create a sell plan during this bear market, in order to lock up gains the next time the prices increase. Even though it may seem hard to stomach the thought of selling Bitcoin at $50,000 when it seems that $100,000 is right around the corner, sticking to a sell plan is important for actually making profits. If nobody ever sells, then nobody ever makes a profit, and all of the worry and money poured into investing was a waste. A solid sell plan will ensure that investors capture some of their gains, while also still giving them the potential to make more. Even though following these strategies will not guarantee that investors make money, it will certainly help with the worry, doubt, and fear that takes hold during bear markets. Investors need to remember to be emotionless, dollar cost average, and only hold projects that they believe in. Not only will this help them ensure that they will not lose all of their money, but also will help them sleep better at night knowing that their investments are safe.

In these auctions, many projects will be competing for one of one hundred parachains, which are blockchains that can connect to Polkadot\u2019s Relay Chain, allowing them to be interoperable and take advantage of network effects. In order to raise enough funds to secure a spot, projects will be partaking in Parachain Loan Offerings, or PLOs, to raise funds from the community. Unlike ICOs, PLOs only require that users delegate their funds to projects for a specific amount of time, usually a year. After this time, an investor regains access to their DOT, as well as the token they chose to support. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the top projects vying for one of these lucrative spots, what they are trying to accomplish, and how likely it is that they will receive a slot. The biggest project building on Polkadot, and the most likely to win a parachain, is Acala. They are building a DeFi hub for Polkadot, which will be a direct competitor to DeFi apps on Ethereum. One of their features is the Acala stablecoin, known as the Acala Dollar, which is similar to DAI and Maker DAO on Ethereum. They are also building a lending and borrowing protocol that will allow users to borrow or lend Polkadot tokens like ACA, their stablecoin, and DOT. This is similar to Aave and Compound on Ethereum. Additionally, they are creating a decentralized exchange, which will be Polkadot\u2019s version of Uniswap. The ACA token will be the governance token for all their projects. If they are able to capture even a fraction of the value of DeFi on the Ethereum blockchain, ACA could easily reach a billion-dollar market capitalization.12% of the total supply of ACA tokens will be made available for the slot auction, and around 36% will be made available through liquidity mining and other community incentives.Phala Network is another strong candidate to win a slot in the upcoming auctions. They are the main privacy project developing on Polkadot, and are solving an important problem: private smart contracts. Right now, on a blockchain like Ethereum, all smart contracts are public and anyone can view information about transactions, such as addresses involved and amounts transferred. Phala is creating a \u201cglobal confidential compute cloud\u201d which will allow for private transactions and smart contracts. Since they are building on Polkadot, Phala will also offer private transactions from one blockchain to another. Since the majority of people do not want their financial activity to be public, projects like Phala will be crucial for the long-term adoption of cryptocurrencies.The PHA token is already available as an ERC20 and BEP20 token, so it can be bought using decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Pancakeswap. 9% of the total supply is reserved for the parachain slot auction.One exciting project with lucrative parachain loan auction incentives is Bifrost.They are creating a cross-chain ecosystem that will bring liquidity to assets that are staked or bonded. For example, if someone uses Bifrost to stake their DOT, they will receive a token, vDOT, in return, which represents their stake to the DOT and can be used in DeFi applications. This allows for a vast array of new use cases to come to DeFi, as users are able to take full advantage of their staked assets by earning a yield or hedging risk. Additionally, they plan to remove the 28-day unbonding period for DOT and allow for instant deposits and withdrawals to the staking ecosystem. Any proof of stake coin that is in the Polkadot ecosystem will eventually be supported by Bifrost. 13.75% of the token supply will be sold during their PLO.At the moment, their most exciting feature is what they are calling their \u201ctriple BNC airdrop.\u201d When a user delegates funds to their auction process, they will receive three coins: BNC, vsDOT, and vsBond. BNC is the Bifrost coin, which is used for governance in their protocol. vsDOT is the staked version of DOT that will be given to users, which allows them to effectively have their tokens unlocked quicker than the 1-year delegation period that would normally be in effect. Finally, users will get the vsBond token, which is the slot auction reward for the specific parachain lease. At the end of the 1-year delegation period, users can choose to redeem their vsDOT and vsBond for DOT on a 1-to-1 basis. This system effectively removes the opportunity cost typically associated with the loan offerings, and gives users the opportunity to take full advantage of their capital.Moonbeam is another project bringing more features and capabilities to the Polkadot ecosystem. Specifically, they are creating a protocol which allows for the re-deployment of Ethereum smart contracts on Moonbeam\u2019s blockchain. This will allow any EVM-based project, such as Uniswap, Aave, and Compound, to easily deploy and be interoperable with Polkadot-based projects. The token, GLMR, is used to pay for fees in the same way that ETH is used on the Ethereum blockchain. 15% of GLMR\u2019s total supply is earmarked for the parachain auction. There are many promising projects building on Polkadot and offering their tokens via parachain loan offerings. The opportunity to invest in the ground level of Polkadot will be historic for the cryptocurrency space, and may just be the ticket to 100x gains for investors.

Right now, the most likely candidates are Circle, BlockFi, and Bakkt, however it is likely that there will be a massive increase in the number of public crypto companies in the near future.Almost every startup company has one goal: go public on the stock exchange and become a household name. Unfortunately, most startups never achieve this dream, however those that do are cemented as one of the strongest companies in their industry, as they have successfully garnered enough attention to be considered a legitimate investment opportunity by Wall Street. As one could imagine, the majority of Wall Street did not view any cryptocurrency-related company as anything but a gamble up until recently. Now that Coinbase has become the first publicly-traded cryptocurrency company and has amassed a valuation of nearly $60 billion, investors are looking for the \u201cnext Coinbase\u201d that may be going public. Luckily for them, there are several companies in the space looking to be listed on the United States stock market over the coming months and years. Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, is likely to be the second cryptocurrency company listed on the stock exchange. They plan to go public via SPAC, specifically Concord Acquisition Corp (CND), by the end of 2021. Along with creation and upkeep of the USDC stablecoin, they also offer institutional DeFi accounts, a yield service, and a payment solution interface. One of their biggest partnerships is with Visa, who has used USDC to settle a payment in a test run. Their current valuation is $4.5 billion, which seems low considering that they are in charge of the fastest-growing stablecoin with a current market capitalization of $26 billion. However, investing in Circle also carries the risk of stablecoin regulation, which could hinder Circle\u2019s biggest product and significantly stifle their innovation.Another company with intentions to go public in the near future is Bakkt, the cryptocurrency exchange majority-owned by the Intercontinental Exchange. In 2017, during the previous bull run, the release of Bakkt was incredibly anticipated, as it promised a derivatives platform and easy access for institutional investors. Unfortunately, when it finally released in 2019, it failed to live up to expectations, and now has little-to-no volume on its trading pairs. Since then, it has transitioned into an all-in-one crypto suite with a wallet, custody options, a payment solution, and, strangely enough, gift card management. Bakkt is going public via SPAC, specifically VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings (VIH). After the public announcement in January 2021, the VIH price quickly shot up from a price of $10 to $20, but has since fallen to below $10, signaling that investors are no longer as excited as they once were about this company. Their current valuation is $2.1 billion.BlockFi, the cryptocurrency finance platform whose main product is its lending service, is also rumored to want to go public within the next year or so. Their interest account, which uses an overcollateralized loan system in order to ensure fund safety, allows users to earn 7.5% on stablecoins, 4% on Bitcoin, and also supports a plethora of other assets. They are in the process of a Series E fundraising round, where they hope to raise $500 million and bring their total valuation to $5 billion. Along with lending, they also offer trading services, institutional accounts, and are planning to create a crypto credit card. As a New York-based financial company, going public is obviously one of their biggest objectives moving forward. Another company who has expressed plans about going public is Ripple, the company behind top 5 cryptocurrency XRP. Ripple is the company in charge of spearheading adoption for the Ripple Payments network, which also utilizes the XRP coin. They have partnerships with some of the world\u2019s largest banks, such as Bank of America, and aim to create a fast, efficient banking payment solution to rival SWIFT, which is the current cross-border bank payment tool. Ripple\u2019s main obstacle to going public is their ongoing lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The lawsuit claims that Ripple illegally sold XRP as an unregistered security. Right now, it appears that the case will go in Ripple\u2019s favor, and if so, they plan to go public shortly after. Even though the success of these individual companies is far from guaranteed, one thing is certain: the greater proliferation of cryptocurrency companies into the traditional stock market will be positive for the entire cryptocurrency market, as it further legitimizes cryptocurrencies as a new digital asset class and offers all investors exposure to the nascent technology.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3509924","Time":1626448402,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.037,"neu":0.831,"pos":0.132,"compound":0.9976,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.4988},"29":{"Title":"Polkadot\u2019s Parachain Slot Auctions: The Next Generation of ICOs","Content":"Polkadot\u2019s upcoming parachain slot auctions, in which projects will bid for one of one hundred parachains, have the potential to revitalize the massive fundraising movement that was seen with ICOs in 2017. It will also bring lots of capital and interest to the Polkadot ecosystem, which will help it to become the main interoperability project. In 2017, right around the time that cryptocurrencies were first becoming mainstream and Bitcoin was beginning its ascent to $20,000, a new fundraising model was born: the initial coin offering, or ICO. This funding option, which is similar to the traditional initial public offering, or IPO, allowed for Ethereum-based projects to sell tokens to users for Ethereum, and resulted in projects raising large amounts of capital in order to fund their endeavors. The capability to raise money without having to go to venture capital firms was revolutionary, and immediately became one of the hottest cryptocurrency topics of the time.Much like the NFT craze of early 2021, there were many legitimate projects using the ICO model, like Chainlink, Basic Attention Token, and EOS, but there were also many more simply taking advantage of the hype and running away with investor funds. For this reason, along with greater regulatory scrutiny from world governments, most modern projects have abandoned the ICO model, and have instead returned to the traditional method of going to venture capital firms and accredited investors for their initial offerings. However, there is a new project that, through their token offering method, may revitalize public cryptocurrency offerings.Polkadot, a top 10 cryptocurrency created by Ethereum co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood, is an interoperability solution which will allow independent blockchains to interact with one another. This is a revolutionary concept, as it will help something like the Bitcoin blockchain to easily and trustlessly interact with Ethereum or Cardano. This will allow the hundreds of billions of dollars locked on the Bitcoin blockchain to be able to interact with DeFi and other smart contract capabilities, which will significantly increase the usability and flexibility of cryptocurrencies. They are accomplishing this feat through a model that uses a relay chain and parachains. The relay chain is a main chain that connects all of the different blockchains, and a transaction from one blockchain to another requires going through the relay chain. Parachain is the technical term for the blockchains that will connect to the relay chain.An interesting characteristic of the Polkadot ecosystem is that they are planning on supporting a mere 100 parachains. In order to decide which projects get to use the parachains and join the interoperability ecosystem, they are holding a parachain slot auction for each slot, which will be bought in DOT, the native currency of Polkadot.In order to raise enough capital to guarantee a parachain slot, many projects are offering their tokens as incentive to potential supporters. At first glance, this may appear similar to the traditional ICO model, where a project takes DOT in exchange for their own tokens, but there is a unique twist never-before-seen in ICOs: project supporters do not need to sell their DOT in order to support a project and receive its tokens. Instead, they delegate their DOT to the project, which is similar to staking to a validator, and then their DOT is locked for the next 52 weeks. This is because projects do not \u201cbuy\u201d a parachain, but instead rent it for a specified amount of time. In exchange, an investor will receive the project\u2019s tokens, and get their DOT back at the end of the lock-up period. This model is extremely interesting, as it allows for investors to support projects while not having to worry about losing funds or getting scammed. If a project wins a parachain slot, it is almost guaranteed that their token will perform well as long as the Polkadot ecosystem grows. If it does not win, an investor\u2019s funds will be kept for the next couple of auctions, as a project continues to try and win a slot, but will eventually be returned. For an investor who holds DOT, these token sales are almost a no-brainer. The only downside is that the funds are locked for a year, and that these tokens cannot be staked for a 13% APY. However, tokens offer much higher upside potential than staking, and could be the ticket to sky-high returns. Right now, slot auctions are taking place on Kusama, which is the incentivized testnet of Polkadot. Assuming all goes well, Polkadot slot auctions are expected to start in Q3 2021, and continue for the next year. The excitement around the parachain slot auctions may also have a direct impact on the price of DOT, since users need to buy DOT to participate in the auctions. Since this happened with ETH during the ICO craze, there is precedence for this to happen again with DOT. Furthermore, as users stake DOT for an entire year, there will be significantly less in circulation, and a decrease in supply with no change in demand leads to an increase in price by the basic laws of economics. The Polkadot parachain slot auctions are going to be one of the most exciting opportunities in the cryptocurrency space since the ICO craze from four years ago. It will bring new capital to the Polkadot ecosystem and help it achieve its goal of becoming the main interoperability protocol for the cryptocurrency space, while also offering investors risk-free exposure to new and exciting projects.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3506436","Time":1626291900,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.028,"neu":0.852,"pos":0.12,"compound":0.9981,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.49905},"30":{"Title":"What is Axie Infinity and Why is Its Token Up 600% in Two Weeks","Content":"The past couple weeks have been uneventful for most cryptocurrencies due to sideways price action, but one coin has managed to rise over 600% in that timeframe: AXS, the native token of Axie Infinity, which is a Ethereum-based NFT game similar to CryptoKitties. It has risen due to a number of reasons, but mainly due to growing interest in the game and its ecosystem. Axie Infinity was created in 2018 by the startup company Sky Mavis. It is like a combination of CryptoKitties and Pokemon, which immediately makes it an enticing game for millions of collectors around the world. Users can buy Axies, which are NFT pets with unique stats and characteristics, and level them up through a series of games and challenges. Players can battle, raise, and even breed their Axies, which helps to create an ecosystem surrounding the game. There is also a land element, so players can own tokenized plots of land and build their own digital kingdom.By completing quests, fighting monsters, and growing their kingdom, players can earn Small Love Potions (SLP), which is the native token of the platform. It can be used to breed Axies, which inherit the traits of their parents and can be sold on NFT marketplaces. This is an incredibly unique design, and has been compared to coins in a Mario game having real-world value and tradability. Unlike other NFT pets, Axies require care and nurturing, and there are protections in place to ensure that too much breeding does not destroy their value. One of the biggest investors involved in the project is billionaire investor Mark Cuban, who many know for his role on the popular TV show Shark Tank. He helped lead a fundraising round for the platform in May 2021, which has led to greater interest in the game from mainstream media and investors. In early 2021, the AXS token was created, and it acts as a governance token for the Axie Infinity platform. More importantly, the token also gives the holder a right to a share of the platform\u2019s fees, which makes it a direct bet on the future success of the platform. The token can be both bought on regular exchanges and earned through in-game challenges and quests. The fact that it can be earned through the game is incredibly interesting and unique, as it creates a system in which players can earn a piece of the game that they are playing, similar to if winning Fortnite games gave the player a share of their parent company\u2019s stock.In the near future, AXS will be able to be staked on the platform, and the higher a user\u2019s score in the games, the greater the yield. This will incentivize investors to play the game instead of simply speculating on its success. In the future, the team behind the game plans to create a mobile app, implement governance, and finish some of the other game features that are still a work in progress.In the past month, interest in the game has hit new highs, and there are a record number of players buying and selling Axies on their NFT marketplace. In fact, the Axie Infinity marketplace is the largest marketplace by monthly volume, and is up over 400% from the previous month\u2019s volume. There are now over 250,000 daily active players.In the past two weeks, the price of the AXS and SLP tokens have skyrocketed in value, mirroring the increase in NFT trading volume. AXS is up 600% in the past two weeks, and SLP is up nearly 1000% in the past two months, and both are significantly outperforming the cryptocurrency market. The reasoning behind the increase in volume and price is hard to definitively determine. A probable reason is that cryptocurrency enthusiasts got bored with the sideways movement of the market and began turning to Axie as an entertaining way to spend some of their crypto. This is not a new concept, as gambling and money-based games increased in popularity during the Great Depression, when the stock market tumbled in value. As more users find the game and find it to be a fun pastime, the demand for SLP and AXS will increase, which will lead to higher prices for the tokens. Whether or not this heightened demand will continue is up for debate, but it is clear that Axie Infinity is currently the largest cryptocurrency-based game, and that they are significantly ahead of their competitors in terms of adoption and valuation.

While the NFTs may remain prevalent, the token endorsements will end quickly as the market becomes more regulated.In late 2020 and early 2021, a massive wave of interest coming from the general public hit the cryptocurrency space. The majority of this mania was directed at NFTs, which saw a huge surge in popularity and led to countless artworks, trading cards, and images being minted, and every creator hoped that their NFT would be one of the lucky few to go for millions of dollars on an NFT marketplace. Some of the world\u2019s biggest celebrities, including Snoop Dogg, Rob Gronkowski, and Lindsay Lohan have created their own NFTs, which have sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars each. This represents a significant movement for the cryptocurrency space, as something related to cryptocurrencies is finally becoming mainstream.Even though many criticize the celebrity NFTs as a blatant cash grab, they are positive for cryptocurrencies and blockchain as a whole, and they will not be disappearing into obscurity anytime soon.One of the biggest reasons that celebrities will continue to be involved with NFTs is due to the potential profits. A typical NFT on Ethereum costs a dollar or two to make, but could bring in hundreds of thousands for a celebrity or influencer. These types of profit margins are unheard of for these celebrities, who may get as much from a single NFT sale as they would from an album or movie release. As long as the profits they make are greater than the cost to mint, celebrities and their managers will continue to reap the rewards.Furthermore, due to the newfound popularity of NFTs and NFT marketplaces, millions of users have begun flocking to crypto in order to buy their favorite celebrities\u2019 NFTs. As part of the process, they have to buy Ethereum, set up a MetaMask account, and interact with smart contracts, all things that they would not do otherwise. Whether they realize it or not, they are now part of the DeFi ecosystem, and will eventually find their way to other decentralized applications, which will further contribute to DeFi\u2019s proliferation throughout our society. A final reason for the continued prevalence of celebrity NFTs is due to their simplicity, novelty, and general \u201ccool factor\u201d in the eyes of the public. For example, Major League Baseball player Justin Turner gave every fan who voted for him to be a player in the all star game a free NFT as a thank you. This type of incentive for fans to interact with their favorite athletes and stars is here to stay. It is simple, both for Turner and his fans, while also being a unique item that holds some significance, even if it does not hold monetary value. Although celebrities will continue to mint NFTs and be a part of the ecosystem, there is one area of cryptocurrencies that they will not stay in for much longer: token endorsements.Recently, many scam projects have begun hiring popular celebrities to promote their cryptocurrencies on Twitter. Whether or not the celebrities know that they are promoting scam is unknown, but this type of activity is highly malicious and typically results in a celebrity\u2019s fans losing their money to these projects.For example, Kim Kardashian and boxer Floyd Mayweather were recently hired to promote a coin called Ethereum Max, which has a supply of 2 quadrillion tokens and uses the Ethereum name in order to dupe unknowing investors into thinking that they are buying Ethereum. The coin is down over 80% since these celebrities got involved.Not only are these endorsements unethical, but they are also potentially illegal. In most jurisdictions, giving financial advice without the proper licensing is illegal, and it could be argued that these celebrities are giving financial advice to their fans. In fact, Floyd Mayweather was sued for fraud after promoting the scamcoin Stox during the last bullrun. Although the case was dismissed, it sends the important message that even though cryptocurrencies are unregulated does not mean that scamming is legal. There is a reason that celebrities are not advertising traditional stocks, so it is likely that advertising cryptocurrencies will end as soon as regulation is created for the market. At first glance, it may seem like celebrity NFTs contribute nothing to the overall cryptocurrency market, but this is not the case. They offer benefits to celebrities as a cheap way to make money or reward their fans, and offer fans the opportunity to own a unique item. And, most importantly, it furthers the proliferation and use of blockchain technology, which will foster growth and innovation throughout the ecosystem.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3492346","Time":1625598695,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.052,"neu":0.813,"pos":0.134,"compound":0.9963,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.49815},"33":{"Title":"Does the \u2018Coinbase Effect\u2019 Still Exist, and What Does it Mean for the Market?","Content":"As the most popular exchange in the United States, Coinbase acts as the fiat-to-cryptocurrency onramp for millions of Americans and their billions of dollars.

As a result, Coinbase\u2019s millions of users were left with little altcoin options and did not have exposure to the broader cryptocurrency market. Coinbase\u2019s reasoning was to ensure that they were following all regulatory guidelines and not listing coins that might be labeled as securities, as well as ensuring that there was ample liquidity for the pairs supported on their platform.In October 2018, Coinbase listed their first small-to-medium cap coin: 0x. Immediately after the announcement, 0x\u2019s price skyrocketed from $0.65 to $1.08, solely because of its listing on Coinbase. This trend has continued over the past three years, and every coin listing has led to a massive price increase, dubbed the Coinbase Effect.This is especially true for a couple coins, namely District0x and Civic, which saw 642% and 492% gains, respectively, after their listings in 2020 and 2018. In fact, Messari, a crypto analysis firm, estimated that the Coinbase Effect caused an average of a 92% gain five days after a coin begins trading on the platform, as of April 2021. However, in the past three months the speed at which Coinbase has been listing new assets has greatly increased, and they have listed 20 assets since then, a near-50% increase over the number of listings from before April 2021. This means that there is a lot of new data available, which shows a different result about the impact of the Coinbase Effect. This data shows that the Coinbase Effect still exists, but to a lesser degree. For example, the June 14 announcement that Polkadot will begin trading on the exchange caused a pump of 14%, while the June 24 announcement that Quant would begin trading caused a 50% pump. Mirror Protocol, which was announced as a trading pair on May 4, only pumped around 15%. Many of the other coins listed during this time also experienced percentage price increases in the high teens.As one can see, the data from more recent months demonstrates that the Coinbase Effect has been much more subdued than in the past. This is expected, as with every new asset Coinbase adds, there will be less excitement about the next one, and the group of coins listed on the exchange becomes less exclusive. Another interesting point found in the data has to do with the level of the pump compared to the market capitalization of the coin. Polkadot, which is a consistent top 10 coin, increased just as much as Mirror Protocol, whose valuation makes it the 228th biggest crypto by market cap. Enzyme, the 183rd biggest token, actually saw a decrease in their market cap after its Coinbase announcement. Initially, one would assume that the larger coins would have less of a pump, as they have more liquidity and are already quite established within the market. However, it seems that the market capitalization does not matter much. Instead, the most important factor is investor demand for an asset. Even though it takes more money to move DOT\u2019s price than Enzyme\u2019s MLN token price, more investors were interested in DOT, which caused it to grow much more than the small-cap MLN.The fact that the Coinbase pump is shrinking is beneficial for the market as a whole. No exchange should have control over the price, and a lack of liquidity should not be the reason that one cryptocurrency becomes more popular than another. Furthermore, there have been accusations of insider trading before Coinbase listings, as it sometimes appears that coins increase in value a few days before a listing, signaling that employees and associates are buying before the main announcement. With every new coin listed, Coinbase\u2019s influence over coin prices decreases, and all users have a fair chance to buy whichever crypto they want. Coinbase has recently expressed a desire to list every cryptocurrency that they legally can. With the recent increase in listings, it seems like they are beginning to take this goal seriously, and one can expect that the number of listings will only continue to rise. This increase in listings will cause a gradual decrease in the Coinbase Effect, until it no longer exists. With greater access into more obscure cryptos, investors around the world will experience greater exposure to the cryptocurrency market, thus bringing cryptocurrencies ever-closer to mass adoption and recognition.

The idea of a DAO is the natural evolution of DeFi, and represents a compelling investment opportunity for those who get in early, if the idea captivates investors in the same way DeFi did one summer ago.A decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO for short, is a revolutionary new model for governance that is possible due to the power of the blockchain. In a traditional governance system, like those seen in publicly-traded companies, there is a board of advisors and a team of executives who act as the central authority figures of the company. Shareholders have the right to vote on actions of the company, but the items they vote on originate from this leadership group, so an individual cannot propose a change. Furthermore, traditional companies are created as a single entity, and go through the traditional methods of hiring employees, signing contracts, and otherwise existing in the current business world.A DAO operates in a completely different manner to this current system. Unlike a company, a DAO has no centralized authority. There are many different people with a token that represents a share of the DAO, which is known as a governance token, and anyone can vote on or propose changes to the DAO. A DAO is also governed by smart contracts and code, as opposed to contracts written by lawyers that are only as strong as their enforcement. This means that there is no fraud, embezzlement, or other shady activities that can take place in a DAO, as all the code is transparent and publicly available. It also means that conditions and actions can take place without the need for a middleman, which increases efficiency by reducing costs. An example of a DAO can be seen in the decentralized exchange Uniswap. In September 2020, they gave users of the platform the UNI token, which acts as a governance token, and transitioned from a protocol that was owned and operated by Uniswap labs to a DAO. Now, anyone that holds UNI can vote on changes to the protocol, such as fee changes and grant approvals. If someone wants to add something to the platform, but does not see a vote for it, they can create their own, and have other UNI holders discuss and vote for it. This model is why Uniswap is one of the most decentralized and democratized DeFi products to date, and is fully in the hands of the token holders who believe in the project. Currently, DAOs are not incredibly prevalent in the cryptocurrency space. Only about 2.5% of the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization is made up of projects related to DAOs, and this number could increase significantly in the future, as both DAO technology and awareness improves. It is practically inevitable that DAOs will one day take over many current businesses. For example, DAOs will be instrumental in the greater proliferation of the gig economy, which was started by companies like Uber. Right now, these companies act as the middlemen, and take a cut of user\u2019s profits in order to keep their businesses running. In fact, Uber takes anywhere from 25% to 47% of the fare that a rider pays. With a DAO, this fee could be massively decreased, and result in cheaper services available for users, while also increasing profits for drivers. Furthermore, if the \u201cUber DAO\u201d followed the lead of Uniswap, who distributed tokens to users of the platform, and gave their tokens to drivers, the people that work for the DAO would have a direct influence over the future of the company, and would be incentivized to provide better service in order to increase the value of the DAO. Much like DeFi in the summer of 2020, DAOs could become a promising investment opportunity for investors and believers in the cryptocurrency space. One year ago, the DeFi sector was only worth around $10 billion, but has now skyrocketed to over $72 billion. This was not only due to an increase in technology and opportunities available, but also because of greater interest from mainstream investors, who saw the potential of DeFi to make safe yields on stablecoins and other assets. The DAO sector is now worth $26 billion, nearly half of which comes from Uniswap.If institutional investors become aware of the efficiencies of DAO solutions and begin to understand why they are a revolutionary model, DAO-based projects and DAO creation solutions could skyrocket in value. It remains to be seen when DAOs will go mainstream. However, much like DeFi or NFTs, the potential for DAOs to catch the public eye is high, and it may be only a matter of time before we begin to see the DAO revolution in the business sector.

If the rumors are true, and the USDT token is not collateralized, it could lead to a massive crash in the cryptocurrency market, and lead to a domino effect much greater than the $60 billion market capitalization of USDT.Stablecoins have been instrumental in the proliferation of DeFi and cryptocurrency exchanges. Instead of users having to go through a bank every time they want to exchange their crypto for dollars, they can use a stablecoin, which is a token that is pegged 1:1 to the dollar, and effectively hold USD in their exchange accounts without the hassle of typical US bank account regulations. Without stablecoins, cryptocurrency trading would be much more complex for the average user, and it would be impossible to hold a stable asset while waiting for the right time to buy.One of the best examples of a reputable stablecoin is USDC, which was created by Circle. They are incredibly transparent and ensure that each dollar that is backed by a dollar held in a bank by running monthly audits whose results are made available to the public. This type of transparency is crucial to creating a stablecoin, as it guarantees holders that money is not simply being printed out of thin air, and that it has an actual backing. This is one of the reasons that USDC has become one of the fastest-growing stablecoins, and is widely accepted on almost every major exchange.The only stablecoin more widely accepted is Tether, which was created in 2014 by the Bitfinex exchange. Due to its first-mover advantage in the stablecoin sector, it is accepted on practically every exchange, and consistently has the most volume of any cryptocurrency, reaching an average of $50 billion traded daily. Even though it may appear like all stablecoins are created equal, this is far from the truth. Tether is incredibly controversial in the cryptocurrency community due to their lack of transparency and allegations that they are propping up the market by minting USDT without having a dollar backing, effectively printing money out of thin air that is used to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Throughout Tether\u2019s 7-year history, they have been consistently asked to prove that they are holding the proper collateral, but either refused to be audited or promised that an audit would come soon. No audit ever happened, until the New York Attorney General filed a lawsuit against iFinex, the company behind Bitfinex, in order to force an audit to take place, and reveal other information about the secretive practices taking place behind the scenes. In the audit, which took place after iFinex stalled for over a year, it was revealed that before 2017, Tether had no banking accounts anywhere in the world, meaning that Tether's billions of dollars were not backed by any tangible assets. This is further backed by a paper from 2018 by  John Griffin and  Amin Shams that claims that the 2017 cryptocurrency bull run was fueled by unbacked USDT.Furthermore, the audit revealed that Tether now only holds about 74% of the required collateral, meaning that each Tether should be worth $0.74 instead of $1 based on its reserves. Another massive issue is that these reserves were not even in cash, but instead multiple different financial assets, none of which are detailed in the report and could be made up of a number of junk assets.Another piece of evidence against Tether comes from Jim Cramer, host of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money, and his skepticism about Tether. On his show, he educated his users about Tether\u2019s suspicious backing, and noted that 65% of their holdings are in commercial paper. This should make them one of the biggest holdings of commercial paper in the world, but they have not been able to disclose what they hold and they are not recognized or known by other big buyers of commercial paper.All of these issues could lead to a mass selloff of Tether in the future, when holders realize that the asset is not what it appears to be.If this happens, the crash will have consequences far surpassing its $60 billion market capitalization. At first glance, it may seem like the main impact will be that $60 billion is wiped from the total cryptocurrency market cap, which would not have a major effect on the $1 trillion market. However, the much more likely scenario is worse: all the holders of Tether would begin selling it for Bitcoin and other stablecoins, effectively creating $60 billion of sell orders on exchanges. Even the world\u2019s biggest exchanges could not take this level of demand, and it is likely that the price of Bitcoin and other assets would collapse as the monetary tool that has allegedly been propping up their price begins to lose value.Even though this seems like it may be the beginning of the end for the cryptocurrency market, it is far from the truth. Getting rid of Tether while the crypto market is still relatively immature would be the best-case scenario, as it ensures that any future growth from Bitcoin is purely due to honest investing, and not price propping. Ideally, Tether will slowly lose market dominance as people move to other better stablecoins, and we never have to see the asset crash. If it does crash, there will most definitely be short-term volatility in cryptocurrency, but crypto will be capable of bouncing back stronger than before.

Instead, the price continued to correct downwards after a slight upwards movement, and the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has lost as much as $500 billion in the past week. This is due to several factors, including the exodus of Chinese miners, potential manipulation, and the traditional market cycle.Even though most investors know that cryptocurrencies are incredibly speculative and subject to major crashes, nobody likes to see their investment decrease by 20% or more overnight. Unfortunately, this is exactly what has happened lately with cryptocurrencies, as the correction from last month has become revitalized and caused the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to decrease even more. A lot of the daily volatility of Bitcoin has no real cause, and thus is hard to correlate with events. However, this most recent downtown may have a correlation with real world events that have proven to be negative for the cryptocurrency market as a whole.One of the biggest news stories in crypto over the past couple of months has been the banning of cryptocurrency mining in China, which follows their ban on trading cryptocurrencies from 2017. This is significant, as 65% of Bitcoin\u2019s hashing power comes from miners and mining hardware in the country, and miners from all provinces, regardless of whether they use green or dirty energy, have been forced to shut down. The Chinese government\u2019s reasoning for this ban is to protect investors from the wild and speculative nature of the markets, and most likely has to do with the rollout of their own central bank digital currency. Ever since the bans started taking effect, the hashing power of the Bitcoin network, which is a measure of its security, has been decreasing significantly, and is now down over 44% from its all-time high. This has spooked some investors, who take this as a sign that it is the beginning of the end for Bitcoin.While it is true that the short-term outlook of Bitcoin is negative due to the mining bans, it will have a positive effect in the long-term. Miners will be forced to move to other areas, which will help decentralize the network and promote the use of green energy. So even though the network is not as strong as it once was, it is almost guaranteed to come back stronger than ever once the miners are finished relocating. Additionally, the hashing power of the network now is still five times higher than it was in the previous 2017 bull market, meaning the network is still incredibly secure.Another event that may be causing the cryptocurrency downturn is potential manipulation from Bitcoin whales. Due to the lack of regulation in most countries, the manipulation of Bitcoin\u2019s price is completely legal, which allows the biggest holders to change the price to make a profit. This means that some of the world\u2019s biggest companies, hedge funds, and individuals could be working together to suppress the Bitcoin price and buy more at these decreased levels. Although this is complete speculation and it is in no way proven that there is mass collusion in the space, there have been appearances in the price charts of Bitcoin that suggest that manipulation is taking place. If this is true, and Bitcoin whales are suppressing the price to accumulate more, the cryptocurrency downturn will quickly reverse once the manipulation stops and whales are comfortable with their increased crypto holdings.The most likely cause of the downturn is simply due to the cyclical nature of the market. Cryptocurrencies have seen their fair share of price volatility in their short history. Since Bitcoin was created in 2008, there have been about four market cycles, each following a similar pattern: Bitcoin starts low, increases rapidly to a new all-time high, then comes crashing down to a value near the all-time high of the previous market cycle. This trend is exactly what we have seen so far in the 2021 bear market: Bitcoin started the year around $10,000, sharply rose to $60,000, and is now hovering in the $20,000 to $30,000 range, which is around the previous all-time high from 2017 of $20,000. It typically takes around three years for one of these cycles to complete, so if this is what is happening, Bitcoin may not reach $100,000 until 2023 or later. However, as soon as a pattern can be identified in the market, it is no longer a pattern, as traders try to take advantage of this \u201cpredictable\u201d action, which ends up making it unpredictable once again. Even though nobody truly knows why the crypto markets move in the way they do, it is important to remember that the short-term price fluctuations have no effect on the technology, impact, or long-term potential of digital assets. Furthermore, every possible cause discussed has a solution that will inevitably happen, which will make the entire ecosystem more decentralized, mature, and ready for worldwide adoption.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3467740","Time":1624519721,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.066,"neu":0.858,"pos":0.077,"compound":0.7966,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.3983},"37":{"Title":"Dogecoin versus Shiba Inu: Which Memecoin is the Better Investment","Content":"Meme investing has taken over the retail trading scene. Stocks such as AMC and GameStop are up thousands of percentage points on the year, and this type of hype and meme-fueled investing has made its way into the cryptocurrency space. The two biggest memecoins are Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, and while both are far from good investments, Shiba is higher risk, higher reward, and Dogecoin is the safer long-term play.Ever since the GameStop and AMC short squeezes in early 2021, meme investing has seen a massive spike in popularity. The idea of \u201cmeme investing\u201d involves investing into companies based on their hype and meme value, rather than their actual fundamentals. The idea is that if everyone buys and never sells, the price will skyrocket, and make everyone rich. As one would expect, this type of investing is incredibly risky, and creates more losers than winners, but if one is able to buy a meme stock or coin before it blows up, they can become overnight millionaires. This exact pattern played out with Dogecoin, the original memecoin in the cryptocurrency space, which was released in 2013. At the time, it traded for practically nothing, and had a fairly small market cap. However, in early 2021, it began climbing rapidly, and reached a high of nearly 70 cents and a market capitalization of over $90 billion. It has recently corrected to a price around 30 cents, but is still up over 100,000% over the coin\u2019s price one year ago.Dogecoin has no use case other than payments, has a 5% inflation rate, and relies on the Litecoin miners to provide security to its blockchain. Even though it has little fundamental value, it has quickly become Elon Musk\u2019s favorite cryptocurrency, and he constantly praises it on his Twitter feed, which has helped fuel its meteoric rise. Naturally, this type of gain does not go unnoticed, and many projects tried to create their own Dogecoin copies, which used flashy branding and a high circulating supply to dupe retail investors into buying the coin. Many coins, like Safemoon and Doge Token, were created with billions, if not trillions, of coins in circulation, and offered no improvements or any fundamental reason to invest, other than the fact that if other people invested the price would increase. The reason these projects choose to mint so many coins is because it makes the price per coin incredibly low, sometimes as low as $0.0000001, which makes average investors think that the price can reach a dollar easily and make them an instant millionaire. Obviously, this is not the case, as market capitalization is determined by the total supply of coins multiplied by their price, and a coin with a supply of 50 trillion at a price of $1 would be worth more than the entire United States stock market.Shiba Inu, however, was able to stand out from the crowd of memecoins and become the people\u2019s choice to be a \u201cDoge Killer.\u201d It was released as a token on the Ethereum blockchain in August 2020, with a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens. There is no true reason why the SHIB token was chosen by retail investors to be the best memecoin, but that did not stop the price from rising a meteoric 12000x in the time since its release. However, it is down over 70% from its all-time high, which is still a massive profit for anyone lucky enough to buy around the coin\u2019s release.The future roadmap of the Shiba Inu project includes releasing ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange that will allow users to buy and sell tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. This exchange will have two other tokens, LEASH and BONE. Both of these tokens have an unknown use case related to the exchange, and more information will be released when ShibaSwap gets closer to release.The fact that there is no current use case for LEASH or BONE makes them incredibly speculative investments. Furthermore, ShibaSwap will most likely be a clone of Uniswap, and offer no value to the DeFi ecosystem.Given the complete lack of a use case for either project, it may appear difficult to decide which one is the better investment. Although SHIB is smaller, it has more room to grow, and if ShibaSwap does turn out to be a success, it could reach new hype-fueled highs. On the other hand, it has been around for less than a year, and has yet to prove that it has any staying power within the cryptocurrency community. If this market downturn continues, investors may lose interest in SHIB, and move to safer cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin has survived multiple crashes and continually proved that even though it is a memecoin, it has investor interest and will not be going anywhere anytime soon. It is supported by big names such as Mark Cuban and Elon Musk, and has integrated itself so deeply within the cryptocurrency community that there will always have a place for it in the Top 100. For that reason, Dogecoin appears to be safer than Shiba Inu, but investing into any meme currency is a recipe for disaster, unless you are lucky enough to sell before it crashes.Even though meme coins are fun and have a chance of going to the moon, they also should be treated as a gamble, instead of a true investment. That being said, even though Dogecoin seems fundamentally unable to become the world\u2019s digital reserve asset, as Elon Musk once said, \u201cArguably the most entertaining outcome, the most ironic outcome, would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of Earth of the future,\u201d and he is not wrong.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3457978","Time":1624216301,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.045,"neu":0.803,"pos":0.152,"compound":0.9988,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.756,"pos_right":0.244,"compound_right":0.4404,"Total Score":0.91504},"38":{"Title":"What is Taproot, the Newest Upgrade to the Bitcoin Blockchain","Content":"As the first cryptocurrency ever created, Bitcoin is lacking in features that some other cryptocurrencies have. The Taproot upgrade, slated to be implemented sometime in November 2021, will bring a plethora of features to Bitcoin, including lower fees, enhanced privacy, and the potential for smart contracts.When Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2008, he envisioned the protocol as a \u201cpeer-to-peer digital cash.\u201d He did not, however, predict the rise of smart contracts and decentralized finance, which have taken the world by storm and promise to be the backbone for the next generation of the internet. As a result, the Bitcoin blockchain has always been quite simple, and has no features other than the storing and transferring of BTC. Though this was revolutionary in 2008, there have been many developments in the past 13 years, and proponents of Bitcoin are looking to make the cryptocurrency more competitive and make it more likely to keep its title as the top coin in the future. The Taproot upgrade is a series of changes that will help scale Bitcoin and bring new use cases to the network. The first of these changes is the transition in the way that transactions are confirmed. To confirm a transaction, a user must prove that they own the address that they want to use to transfer funds, and this can be proven with their private key. Using the private key, a user will sign a signature that, due to cryptography and advanced math, proves that they own the address in question, and any transfer of funds is valid. Since its release, Bitcoin has used the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, or the ECDSA. It was chosen due to its reliability and security, both of which are incredibly important for securing a blockchain.However, there is a relatively new signature algorithm called Schnorr Signatures that vastly expands upon its predecessor and offers multiple benefits for users.One of the most important benefits is that to privacy, especially with multi signature wallets.  A multi signature wallet is a Bitcoin wallet that has multiple private keys and requires every private key in order to confirm a transaction. With ECDSA, the blockchain publishes the fact that a certain address has multiple private keys, which could be a security threat. On the other hand, Schnorr Signatures compile all of the private keys together such that a multi signature transaction looks no different than any other on the network, and uniformity makes individual transactions harder to trace, resulting in greater privacy. This will be useful for easier implementation of the Lightning Network, a Layer 2 scaling solution that can take advantage of some of Taproot's technology, ultimately leading to better scaling for Bitcoin. Schnorr Signatures are also able to be confirmed in a batch, instead of the required one by one verification of ECDSA. This means transactions will be cheaper and faster for the entire network.Due to the reduction in computing power and uniformity of transactions, Taproot also offers the potential for smart contracts to be created on Bitcoin. It is likely that they would still be significantly more expensive than Ethereum or other smart contract platforms and be limited in functionality. Regardless, the ability for the $1 trillion worth of Bitcoin to interact with smart contracts is massive, and could help bring smart contract technology mainstream. The upgrade is slated to take place around November 2021 and will occur through a soft fork. A soft fork means that the blockchain upgrades without any risk of a hard fork, which opens the possibility for a split to occur. In fact, this is exactly what happened last time Bitcoin had an upgrade, which was in 2017 and resulted in the creation of Bitcoin Cash. Soft forks are somewhat controversial, as noted by Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum, because they force all miners to either upgrade or leave, with no option to dissent. However, they have the potential to be simpler for users, as well as removing the risk for another Bitcoin Cash fiasco. To approve the upgrade, 90% of miners had to agree, which took months to accomplish.Even though the Bitcoin network is antiquated and simple, the Taproot upgrade demonstrates that it is possible to \"teach an old dog new tricks.\" It will keep Bitcoin competitive with newer cryptocurrencies, offer enhanced privacy, and bring the blockchain closer to its goal of being the world\u2019s reserve currency.

However, this will only be a short-term issue for cryptocurrencies, and will make Bitcoin more efficient and decentralized in the long term.  Throughout the history of Bitcoin, China has been a center of innovation and a central location for the majority of the digital asset\u2019s mining power. This is in part due to Bitmain and other companies that make Bitcoin mining hardware being situated in the country. However, since 2017, China has begun regulating the trading of cryptocurrencies, and currently does not allow for retail investors to buy or sell digital assets in order to protect investors from risk. In 2021, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said that the country would crack down on cryptocurrency mining, which sent shockwaves through the Chinese mining community. Many provinces, including Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, have started shutting down Bitcoin miners, and it does not look like this trend will stop anytime soon.There are a couple reasons for the sudden crack down. First, China is releasing their Digital Yuan in the near future, and any cryptocurrency is a threat to its dominance over the digital payment industry. If Chinese citizens only have one option for digital payments, it will gain much more adoption than if it has to compete with Bitcoin. Once the Digital Yuan is established and adopted across the country, the government may reverse their decision and allow Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to be prevalent in the country.The possible second reason for the restriction is because China plans to be carbon neutral by 2060, and the high amounts of miners using coal power is significantly hampering their plans. The places with the most mining shutdowns are the provinces where the majority of energy consumption comes from coal, which is incredibly environmentally unfriendly. In areas where hydroelectric power and clean energy are more common, miners have continued to operate, though some are planning to leave the country in order to avoid being shut down next.These developments have led to a mass exodus of miners from China, which has caused the hash power of the Bitcoin network to decrease over the past months, making it less secure. Though this seems like a serious issue, the moving of mining power will actually be incredibly beneficial to Bitcoin in the long run.Before the mining bans, over 65% of the entire Bitcoin network\u2019s hashing power was based in China. This is concerning, as China effectively has control over the majority of the hashing power, and any government with control over a decentralized currency is dangerous for the health of the network. Now, miners will be forced to disperse across the world, meaning that no one country will be able to control the network.Furthermore, the cryptocurrency mining exodus will help with the carbon emissions and environmental concerns related to mining. Right now, proponents of Bitcoin like Tesla have stated that they will no longer accept Bitcoins as payment for their cars until the environmental concerns related to Bitcoin mining are solved. Currently, one Bitcoin transaction releases nearly 750kg of carbon into the atmosphere and uses as much electricity as a typical American home would use over 54 days. These numbers are unacceptable for socially conscious investors, and the proliferation of green energy will decrease the carbon emissions drastically, leading to greater investment in Bitcoin and a more sustainable future for the digital asset. Miners that are moving from China will go to places where the electricity is cheapest, and the current cheapest forms of electricity are all renewable.Even though the short-term impact of China\u2019s action towards cryptocurrency mining will cause volatility and a decrease in hashing power, the long term implications will be overwhelmingly positive. Much like the rest of cryptocurrency, the mining industry is still in its infancy, and events like these are mere bumps in the road for this industry to become mainstream around the world.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3446117","Time":1623676649,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.067,"neu":0.867,"pos":0.066,"compound":0.5473,"neg_right":0.504,"neu_right":0.496,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":-0.7964,"Total Score":-0.594845},"40":{"Title":"Why is the United States not Ready for a Bitcoin ETF","Content":"With the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, there has also been a rise in the number of institutions and traditional investors who want to begin investing in the digital assets. Currently, there is no way for them to do so through an ETF, but there are multiple ETFs pending approval from United States regulatory commissions. Even though these may be positive for Bitcoin in the short term, the markets are still too immature, and it would ultimately turn many investors away from crypto too quickly.The United States Stock Market. For many, these five words are intertwined with the ideas of capitalism, the American Dream, and \u201cmaking it.\u201d However, the most important association that most investors subconsciously make is that with the safety and regulation provided by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which ensures equal market opportunity for all. Without this guarantee of safety, the investors pouring trillions of dollars into the markets every year, along with the $50 trillion in retirement funds, would not feel comfortable leaving their money in such a risky environment. However, manipulation and a lack of regulation is exactly what could happen if the SEC chooses to approve a Bitcoin ETF in the near future. Right now, there are multiple Bitcoin exchange traded funds, or ETFs, waiting to be discussed and decided upon by the SEC. Some come from some of the biggest names in finance, including Fidelity, while others are more unknown, such as Anthony Scaramucci\u2019s SkyBridge. Regardless of where they come from, their goal is to offer an investment vehicle into Bitcoin for the trillions of dollars that are currently unable to buy, whether due to regulatory reasons or a lack of custody solutions. Though there are currently trusts, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, that allow institutions to buy Bitcoin for their clients, they typically trade at a high price premium on the open market, and as a result are relatively inefficient for the average investor. A Bitcoin ETF would have its holdings backed 1:1 with the digital asset, and thus would not trade at much of a price premium, if at all. It would offer a way for massive amounts of new money to flow into the asset, and would cause an increase in interest and investment never before seen in Bitcoin\u2019s 13-year history. Though this sounds like a no-brainer, an ETF being approved today would cause more harm than good in the cryptocurrency market over the long-term. Right now, the cryptocurrency markets are completely unregulated. This means that anyone, including Elon Musk, can buy, sell, lie, and manipulate the prices as much as they want in order to make a profit. This is partially why the markets are so volatile. Due to the decentralized nature of the currency and lack of a figurehead to pursue, governments are having trouble figuring out how to regulate this new asset class. If the United States decides to enforce traditional securities law to prevent manipulation, and investors in other parts of the world are not subject to these regulations, there will be no difference in the level of manipulation, and the U.S. investors will be left out of the unethical gains that the rest of the world\u2019s Bitcoin whales are making. The only way to truly regulate cryptocurrency would require cooperation from almost every major world government, which is practically impossible.Thus, a Bitcoin ETF would be subject to the whims and desires of a few Bitcoin whales. Those individuals with tens of billions could easily manipulate and steal from institutional investors and retirement funds by shifting the price in their favor over long periods of time. Not only would this cause massive losses to retail and institutional investors, but also would create an atmosphere of distrust around Bitcoin, and could turn off some investors completely. The idea of putting 5% of a pension fund into Bitcoin, then watching it disappear due to manipulation, is enough to make any investor cautious of the asset, and they may decide to ignore it altogether.Some may argue that anyone investing into a Bitcoin ETF should know the risks and that any losses are their fault. Though this is a valid argument, it completely defeats the purpose of the SEC, and begs the question as to why we don\u2019t allow manipulation of all forms in the stock market. Any manipulation will cause prices to move in a way not indicative of an asset\u2019s true value, which makes profitably investing in it incredibly difficult, even for the most risk-averse. The United States will be ready for a Bitcoin ETF once the cryptocurrency market matures more. These manipulators will lose their power as soon as there is enough money in Bitcoin to dilute their holdings to be small enough that they cannot influence the prices, or their holdings increase in value to the point where they can no longer risk losing their large capital. Once this happens, only then will an ETF and the subsequent flood of institutional money into the asset make sense. Until then, retail investors and eager institutions can use the currently-available vehicles to join the cryptocurrency revolution, wait for the ecosystem to become more developed, stomach the massive price volatility, and then reap the benefits of being early adopters.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3442702","Time":1623410272,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.103,"neu":0.746,"pos":0.151,"compound":0.993,"neg_right":0.163,"neu_right":0.62,"pos_right":0.217,"compound_right":0.1754,"Total Score":0.87036},"41":{"Title":"Solana: Ethereum Competitor or Complement","Content":"In the recent weeks of market volatility and bearish sentiment, one coin has been hovering relatively close to its all-time high: Solana. The blockchain, which is capable of handling over 40,000 transactions per second, has potential to be a true Ethereum killer. However, it also could be a complement to the slower, yet more secure, Ethereum, and the two may work in unison as the dominant smart contract protocols.In the most recent market correction, almost every project, even those with the brightest futures, have gone down in value by 40% or more. However, Solana has only gone down 20% from its all-time high, and is up 20% on the week, meaning investors still think the project is undervalued at a market capitalization of $11 billion. The reasoning for this most likely has to do with their continual growth, partnerships, and funding.Solana was created during the ICO craze of 2017, and aimed to fix the blockchain scalability problem without relying on Layer 2 solutions or sharding. It does so through a solution called Proof of History that works in conjunction with proof of stake. Proof of History makes the Solana blockchain have a cryptographic clock, and each transaction is time stamped before being confirmed in the network. Thus, the Solana blockchain is able to know exactly when each transaction was made and can order them quickly and easily compared to another blockchain like Bitcoin, which does not inherently know the order of transactions and thus must waste valuable time and computing power on figuring it out.One of the reasons Solana has seen such explosive growth recently is due to their partnership with FTX, one of the world\u2019s largest centralized exchanges. FTX chose Solana as the blockchain on which they are building their Serum decentralized derivatives exchange, which aims to be even faster than some centralized exchanges. Not only does the FTX partnership bring a killer dApp to the protocol, but it also brings Solana lots of promotion and brand awareness from FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried. He is incredibly influential in the cryptocurrency space, and recently gave Trevor Lawrence, the first pick in the NFL draft, SOL as a signing bonus. This type of marketing will be huge for Solana in the long term, and could help introduce them to companies and people that will greatly expand Solana\u2019s reach.This partnership, along with those from USDC, USDT, Terra, Chainlink, and Arweave, have helped to legitimize the project, and make it a true competitor in the smart contract space. Furthermore, Solana is continuing to raise money in order to create a massive war chest which they can use to incentivize projects to build with their ecosystem. It has recently been revealed that the Solana team is looking to raise over $300 million, which will be instrumental in ensuring that development and partnerships will continue to progress at a rapid pace. Though all of these developments make Solana appear to be directly competing with Etheruem, there are a couple issues that make the likelihood of it being a complement to Ethereum much higher. Much like any blockchain, high speeds typically come at the price of centralization, and the same is true for Solana. To be a validator on their mainnet, a user needs to have expensive and specialized hardware, which is a large barrier to entry. They currently have around 500-1000 validators, which is far less than Ethereum 2.0\u2019s 60,000 validators. They have also had issues in the past with complete network outages lasting multiple hours, which is unacceptable for a permissionless and decentralized blockchain. They are actively working on solving both of these issues, but it may be a while before a solution is found. Furthermore, Solana is not EVM-compatible, which means that any Ethereum-based dApps can not easily be ported to the Solana chain, and instead have to be completely rewritten. This barrier means that it is unlikely that we will see Aave or Uniswap on Solana anytime soon.Due to Solana\u2019s blockchain being fast, yet somewhat insecure, compared to Ethereum\u2019s completely secure, yet slow, blockchain, they are not necessarily competing with one another. Due to there already being an Ethereum-Solana bridge, anyone can easily interact with Solana using Ethereum and ERC20 tokens. This means that a possible long-term scenario could see Ethereum as the main secure blockchain, similar to a savings account, and Solana as the fast blockchain used for day-to-day transactions. This system would be ideal, as it gives Solana the advantage of working with Ethereum instead of against it, and also gives the Ethereum ecosystem a way to transact without worrying about high fees and slow transactions.In fact, this type of relationship is already happening today. Audius, the decentralized music streaming protocol, uses both Solana and Ethereum for different functions within its ecosystem. Audius uses Solana to manage common activities such as streaming, searching, and music management. However, it uses Ethereum for all activities relating to their AUDIO token, including staking and governance. This system means that Audius is able to take advantage of the scalability of Solana without sacrificing the security of the token that runs the entire project. Whether or not the Solana-Ethereum dual blockchain model will continue to be implemented is yet to be seen. However, the fact that Solana can act as both a competitor and a complement means that it has a great chance of surviving the next cryptocurrency crash, and will likely turn into a legitimate staple of the blockchain sector.

Even though this is a historic first, and marks a massive milestone for the cryptocurrency, it is not as monumental as the headlines make it appear, and there are ulterior motives behind the decision. When it was announced on Saturday that the president of El Salvador proposed a bill to congress that would make Bitcoin legal tender, cryptocurrency fans around the world rejoiced. Bitcoin is finally being recognized by a world government as a true digital reserve currency, and some believe this is the beginning of a trend that will eventually lead all governments to recognizing Bitcoin. However, the reasoning behind Bitcoin\u2019s adoption in the country has other motives besides the idea of promoting decentralization and money not controlled by any government. First, it is important to understand what would happen in El Salvador if Bitcoin is declared legal tender. According to Investopedia, legal tender is \u201canything recognized by law as a means to settle a public or private debt or meet a financial obligation, including tax payments, contracts, and legal fines or damages.\u201d This definition is far different than the general public\u2019s perception. As a legal tender, merchants can still refuse to accept Bitcoin as payment for goods and services, but the government cannot. It may also mean that buying items using Bitcoin, which is widely regarded as a sale of property and subject to capital gains tax, will now be seen as a simple currency transaction, with no taxes levied. Another barrier against Bitcoin\u2019s adoption by merchants in the country is their other legal tender currency: the US dollar. Unlike Venezuela or Argentina, who adopt Bitcoin in order to avoid the volatility of their unstable government currencies, El Salvador primarily uses the dollar, which is the world reserve currency and as stable as one can get. Merchants will be more unlikely to adopt Bitcoin since it is unnecessary for day-to-day transactions. On the other hand, if Bitcoin was made legal tender in a country with an unstable currency, merchants and citizens would likely replace their government-issued currency with Bitcoin.Regardless, the recognition of Bitcoin as legal tender will still be significant in terms of adoption, but far from the Bitcoin-centric economic system that some were thinking would occur in El Salvador.Furthermore, President Bukele did not propose to legalize Bitcoin to further the ideology of decentralization, but for an ulterior motive. In January, it was revealed that El Salvador\u2019s financial regulatory agency did not close the accounts of known money launderers and criminals. This and other corruption-related activities relating to high-ranking officials in the country has led the United States to consider imposing sanctions on the Central American country. They are also forming relationships with China and Russia, which America sees as a threat. Making Bitcoin a backup currency option means that any sanctions by the United States can be avoided easily, and also brings more recognition and popularity to the small country. It also makes Bukele more popular with the general public, as he is now seen as one of the figureheads of the cryptocurrency adoption movement. An unintended side effect of El Salvador\u2019s decision could be more regulation for Bitcoin in the future. If the United States decides to impose a sanction, and figures out that El Salvador is avoiding it through Bitcoin, they will do everything in their power to stop this from happening. Though unlikely, the United States could ban transacting Bitcoin privately, and only allow it through regulated exchanges. This may not be a death knell for Bitcoin, but would significantly hinder its adoption. As a nationless currency, it would be hard to argue that Bitcoin is being used to rival any government, but still could pose a threat to the United States\u2019 implementation of sanctions and trade restrictions. Even though all of the developments surrounding Bitcoin\u2019s first recognition as a legal tender seem negative, there are many positives associated with the decision as well. The fact that Bitcoin is stable and secure enough for a world government, no matter how small, to choose it as a legal tender is massive. Other countries in Central America or around the world could follow suit, and then the momentum would continue to build and influence even more countries to make a similar decision. If Bitcoin became legal tender in even five percent of countries, there adoption would reach never-before-seen levels, and could mark a new age in the digital currency\u2019s dominance.

Unfortunately, a lot of these projects seem to get hacked. The reason for this has to do with the nature of these projects and their intention to be a get rich quick platform instead of a revolutionary finance tool.A typical week in cryptocurrency news is almost guaranteed to always have three stories: a famous figure praises crypto, another famous figure speaks out against it, and a Binance Smart Chain project is hacked. In the past couple of months, large projects such as Pancakebunny, Uranium Finance, Meerkat Finance, Spartan Protocol, and Burgerswap have been hacked, causing damages totaling over $300 million. Retail investors, who use BSC due to its fast and cheap transaction times compared to Ethereum, experience a loss of trust in the cryptocurrency space as a whole due to the hacks, which could contribute to the mass exodus of retail investors from the cryptocurrency market.Even though it seems odd that all of these hacks and scams are happening on BSC, there is actually a simple explanation which relates to the chain\u2019s history and usage.Binance smart chain was created in response to the high fees and slow transaction times on Ethereum. It basically cloned the Ethereum network and changed the consensus mechanism to only have 21 validators confirming transactions using a proof of stake model. This is more efficient than Ethereum\u2019s proof of work mechanism, but comes at the cost of strong centralization. To their credit, BSC plans to make themselves more unique and does not consider themselves an Ethereum competitor.However, centralization does not appear to matter to the average retail investor, as BSC has seen a massive influx of users on their platform taking advantage of their suite of decentralized applications. Since BSC is used primarily by retail investors, and Ethereum is the main blockchain with real technical developments, many of BSC\u2019s biggest dApps are simply clones of Ethereum\u2019s. For example, PancakeSwap started as a direct clone of Uniswap, and Meerkat Finance\u2019s code is extremely similar to Yearn Finance\u2019s. There are also dApps catering directly to retail investors and taking advantage of their lack of knowledge about tokenomics. The reason that these appeal to retail investors only is because institutional investors do a lot more research about a project, and typically do not invest in clones, but instead in projects that are unique and offer value.Many of the DeFi projects offering 1000% gains on BSC are not as lucrative as they seem. The projects typically have a useless token with a massive inflation rate, which is how they can advertise such high returns. With so little thought and care put into the long-term tokenomics, it makes sense that the development team may also forget to put checks in place to prevent hacks. For example, the Pancakebunny protocol, which called itself a \u201cyield aggregator,\u201d advertised a 150% APY by giving out their BUNNY token, which had no use other than to govern the protocol. The governance rights were only over other BUNNY and CAKE tokens, so BUNNY had little use to begin with. When they were hacked, it was technically an attack on the token using economic means, not technical, but still proves that these projects offer little innovation.Another example is Meerkat Finance\u2019s hack. Meerkat launched their MKAT token and platform on March 3, then one day later scammed their users and stole around $30 million in user funds. Meerkat was a fork of Alpaca Finance, which was a fork of Yearn Finance. In the search for massive gains, retail investors failed to see past the shady and anonymous team and inherent problems with a triple-forked protocol. Yearn has value because it is innovative and has a first mover advantage. Alpaca, while not nearly as innovative as Yearn, is the first aggregator on BSC, and thus has some inherent value. Meerkat offered nothing to the ecosystem, yet investors trusted their money with the protocol expecting massive returns.Spartan Protocol, a liquidity aggregator similar to Uniswap, experienced a smart contract hack in early May. A hacker took advantage of a vulnerability within the contract in order to withdraw more than their fair share of funds from the protocol\u2019s smart contract. In this case, Spartan rushed their project, clearly before it was ready for a public release, and paid the price. Had they gone the traditional route that most legitimate projects go through, which involves multiple third-party audits, bug bounties, and thorough testnet trial runs, they would not have had this issue.These three BSC dApp examples show the three main types of hacks that occur most frequently on the blockchain: tokenomic-related hacks, projects that were created as a scam, and smart contract vulnerabilities.The reason that these appear so frequently on BSC, more so than Ethereum, is because scammers know that BSC is the blockchain used by speculators and retail investors due to the low barrier to entry. Projects with flaws in their tokens or smart contracts rushed into the ecosystem in order to capitalize on the mania surrounding the space, instead of focusing on building a fundamentally sound project. These projects still exist on Ethereum, but are less common due to the high upfront cost of the gas fees, and smaller number of inexperienced cryptocurrency investors using the network. As long as BSC is the most popular smart contract chain to the general public, scam projects and vulnerable smart contracts will continue to be published. There is no solution to the problem, other than for individual investors to do their due diligence about what projects to invest in, and avoid anything that appears too good to be true. If Ethereum 2.0 releases and becomes the main blockchain for retail investors, we can expect this mania to shift from BSC to Ethereum. This issue can never truly be fixed, and individuals can only protect themselves by only putting their money in proven and audited dApps.

This is being worked on by a plethora of protocols and companies, and there are now many Layer 2 scaling solutions being brought to market. However, with so many solutions available, projects will be spread across too many of them, and Ethereum users will lose many of the benefits that Layer 2s bring.It is no secret to anyone that Ethereum has a scaling problem. Currently, it can cost upwards of fifty dollars to make a transaction on Uniswap, and can take fifteen minutes or more. For a blockchain hoping to be a settlement layer for billions of transactions, these numbers are not sustainable, and users will leave for other blockchains unless a solution is found. One of the most common solutions are Layer 2 platforms, which allow users to make fast and cheap transactions on Ethereum, and allow the protocol to be used as intended.As of now, there are three main Layer 2 solutions, but there are many more in development. Polygon, which has been released for about a year, uses Plasma scaling technology and side chains in order to make fast and cheap transactions. Optimism and Arbitrum, two Layer 2s planning to release this summer, are using rollups to achieve an ideal transaction environment while being just as secure as the main Ethereum blockchain. Honorable mentions include Starkware, xDAI, and OMGX. On the surface, having many Layer 2 options to choose from seems like a positive, as it allows for users to have choice over which platform they prefer. However, it also leads to many problems that could destroy the Ethereum ecosystem in the short term.With so many Layer 2s to build on, many of the most popular dApps have been forced to pick a side to build with first. For example, Aave is partnered with Polygon and has deployed their smart contract on their blockchain, Uniswap and Maker DAO are planning to use Optimism, while Sushiswap and Chainlink are building on Arbitrum. Many other smaller projects are also choosing a side, and the distribution of projects seems to be fairly split between the three solutions. Of the three, Optimism seems to have the slight edge in terms of number of projects, but they don\u2019t have enough projects onboard to be able to be the main Layer 2. Though it is possible for projects to build on multiple solutions, they still are required to choose one to initially port their project to, and the vote to join a new Layer 2 could take weeks.Even though an obvious solution may be for protocols like Uniswap to build on all Layer 2s, this will not solve every problem. When Uniswap is on both Optimism and Arbitrum, Uniswap\u2019s liquidity would effectively be split between the two. This means that users on both Layer 2s would experience more slippage on their transactions, meaning that they will not get as good of a deal or be able to transact as much without influencing the asset price. For dApps such as Aave, splitting liquidity would mean that both borrowers and lenders are not able to get the best interest rates possible, thus leading to an economically inefficient outcome and less of a reason for people to switch to using DeFi instead of traditional finance tools. Furthermore, if someone wanted to take their funds from Aave on Polygon and move them to Uniswap on Optimism, they would have to first deposit funds from mainnet Ethereum to Polygon, then back from Polygon to mainnet, and finally from mainnet to Optimism. This could easily cost upwards of $100, and completely negate any benefits created by Layer 2 solutions. We could see a situation in which there is lots of tribalism within the Ethereum community, and some users only use Optimism, while others either use Arbitrum or Polygon. It will be forced tribalism due to the high fees on mainnet, and users will pick the solution that has the majority of their favorite dApps. In the long term, Ethereum 2.0 will solve this problem by making mainnet Ethereum fees cost pennies, but this will not be viable for another year or so.One solution would be to create some sort of bridge from one Layer 2 to another, but this is technically difficult to accomplish without having the fees of mainnet Ethereum. The most likely scenario is that exchanges like Coinbase and Binance will launch centralized services that allow users to exchange their funds from one Layer 2 to another. This will help to solve the aforementioned problem with fees, but not entirely. Users who are unwilling or unable to create accounts that require KYC procedures will be unable to transact without significant fees.Ideally, there would only be one or two Layer 2s that dominate the Ethereum network, each of which has a compelling suite of DeFi applications that allow users to not need to switch from one to the other regularly. Whether this happens or not is entirely up to the forces of economics and the choices made by Ethereum\u2019s dApp developers.

Projects such as Ethereum, Polkadot, and Cardano, along with many others, are rolling out new changes and upgrades this summer which will help them become closer to revolutionizing the financial system.Projects with strong fundamentals continuously develop their product, regardless of the coin price. This summer, we can expect to see some of the biggest and most important developments in the cryptocurrency space\u2019s history. Let\u2019s take a look at some of these projects and what they are planning to release over the coming months. Even though Ethereum 2.0 will not officially be released for a couple more years, there are still lots of developments being made to the protocol that will allow it to keep its title as the king of smart contract platforms. Arguably the biggest change will be the London hard fork in July. This hard fork will introduce EIP-1559, which is the protocol change that will stabilize gas prices and burn some of the transaction fees, instead of giving them all back to the miners. If there are more transaction fees burned than Ether mined per day, ETH could become a deflationary asset, which would make it an incredibly appealing store of value and could help the asset surpass Bitcoin in market capitalization.Another change coming to Ethereum is the release of Layer 2 solutions, specifically Optimistic Ethereum and Arbitrum. Both of these scaling solutions use rollup technology, which will drastically decrease transaction times and increase speed. Arbitrum had their official release in late May, and Optimism is planning to release in July. This will almost completely solve Ethereum\u2019s current transaction fee and scaling problems, and will allow anyone to use dApps without paying hundreds in gas fees. Some of the dApps already building on these solutions include Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Chainlink, and Aave is already available on another L2 solution, Polygon. Once exchanges like Coinbase offer the option for users to buy Ethereum on the Layer 2s, everyone will be able to use Ethereum as it was intended, thus bringing it closer to its goal of being the world's computer. Even though Cardano has been a so-called \u201cEthereum Killer\u201d since its release in 2017, it has yet to add a crucial feature: smart contract functionality. Without this, it is nothing more than a blockchain, with no tokens, dApps, or smart contracts. This is going to change with their Alonzo upgrade in August. After the upgrade, developers will be able to build on Cardano and take advantage of its groundbreaking technology and programming language. This should make Ethereum fans nervous, as it will be the first time Ethereum will have a true competitor in the smart contract space, which will be a great development for the blockchain ecosystem as a whole. Much like Cardano, Polkadot also does not have any tokens building on top of its ecosystem. This is not due to a lack of technology, but instead due to the way Polkadot works. Polkadot supports 100 parachains, each of which is like a separate blockchain that one project can use to build their ecosystem. Instead of giving these parachains away, they are auctioned to the highest bidder in a system known as the Parachain Slot Auction. These auctions, which have drawn the attention of hundreds of projects, are slated to begin on Kusama, Polkadot\u2019s canary network, in the coming weeks. Assuming everything goes well, they are expected to start on Polkadot shortly after. This will be a significant milestone in Polkadot\u2019s history, as projects will begin to build on the so-called \u201cinternet of blockchains\u201d and take advantage of its high throughput and interoperability. It will also cause more demand for the DOT token, which is used to bid on Parachains, that may lead to a significant price increase over the coming months. One of the most hyped projects in recent history, Flare, will begin airdropping its FLR token to XRP holders sometime in June. Flare is creating a smart contract blockchain for the coins that currently have no smart contract functionality, such as XRP, XLM, Litecoin, and Dogecoin. The FLR token will be supported at release by most major exchanges, including Coinbase, Binance, and Bitfinex. The last coins to receive immediate and synchronized listing include Internet Protocol, Uniswap, and The Graph, all of which are still thriving. Flare will bring tens of billions of dollars into the smart contract and DeFi ecosystem, and could pose a threat to already-established smart contract platforms. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, will be hearing many cases about approving a cryptocurrency ETF this summer. Currently, they are expecting to release a decision about a VanEck ETF sometime next month. They also are reviewing a Fidelity ETF and a First Trust SkyBridge Bitcoin ETF as well, and their decisions could come out as soon as July, but they also could be delayed until sometime next year. If approved, an ETF would allow trillions of dollars to begin pouring into cryptocurrencies, and potentially bring Bitcoin to never-before-seen highs. Finally, the team behind Bitpush is releasing Uniquehash, an NFT platform allowing for the seamless buying, selling, and creating of NFTs. It will be based on an EVM-compatible blockchain, and is slated for a release in July. This release will be significant, and offer users easy access into one of the fastest-growing fields in the blockchain space. This summer is full of massive developments across the blockchain space. Due to these new developments and the possibility of a Bitcoin ETF, many investors hope that this summer will revitalize the bull market, and may lead to new all-time highs for the cryptocurrency market.

Trillions of dollars that are in pension funds, trust funds, and brokerage accounts do not have access to cryptocurrency markets, and as soon as this money is able to be invested, crypto markets may surge to new all-time highs.In the past two years, the cryptocurrency market has gone from a valuation of around $100 billion to over $2.5 trillion, a massive increase that has never been seen before in history. This 2500% increase in less than 2 years makes many investors wary about future price potential, as it seems like the only place to go from these prices is down. However, this is far from the case.Right now, the only way to buy cryptocurrencies is through exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. Even though there are trusts such as Grayscale\u2019s Bitcoin and Ethererum trusts or Bitwise's 10 Crypto Index Fund, they are being sold at a massive price premium, sometimes as high as 100%. This means that if someone wants to buy $100 of Ethereum through one of these trusts, they pay around $200. Thus, for any investor that values their money, the main way to buy cryptocurrency is through exchanges.The average retail investor may have no problem creating a Coinbase account and buying $100 of Bitcoin, but for billion-dollar institutions and hedge funds, using Coinbase is simply not an option due to regulations, risks, and difficulties with custody. Instead, they would much rather invest in an ETF, or exchange traded fund, which holds Bitcoin as the primary asset and is traded on traditional stock exchanges such as the NASDAQ. Ideally, this would also be insured against hacks and other black swan events.There is no current cryptocurrency ETF for American investors, but it is highly probable that in the future there will be ways for investors to buy crypto through the safety of their Charles Schwab or Fidelity account. The trading of cryptocurrencies on traditional exchanges will be a massive opportunity for the market, as there will be trillions of dollars that are now able to flood into the asset class.For example, there are currently $50 trillion in retirement funds and the top 500 companies make $33 trillion in revenue annually. If these funds and companies had access to cryptocurrency, and wanted to invest a conservative 10% of their holdings and revenues into the asset, that would be $8 trillion, over four times the current valuation of the entire market. Not only will a growing market cap increase the value of cryptocurrencies, but it will also legitimize them and allow for larger investors to get involved. When Bitcoin was only worth $10 million, it was seen as a fun internet experiment. When it was $1 billion, it was beginning to seem like an interesting investment, but nobody could invest more than a couple million without significantly moving the price. At over $1 trillion, investors and companies around the world are considering it the future of money, and billions can be bought and sold without price fluctuations. If it hits $10 trillion, Bitcoin has a good chance of being the reserve currency for the world, which would make companies and funds feel more comfortable putting hundreds of billions into the asset, furthering its growth and thus further legitimizing its status.Although it is not guaranteed that large funds will buy crypto when it is available, they are certainly interested, which is why there are many cryptocurrency ETF applications pending approval with the SEC. Even the most conservative investment would be a massive signal that institutions want to put crypto in their holdings, and could easily double, triple, or quadruple the cryptocurrency market capitalization given enough time. Though it is uncertain when cryptocurrencies will begin trading on traditional markets, the sentiment is that it is inevitable, and it will bring about a new era in the history of digital assets.

This offers a great buying opportunity for those who have the risk tolerance to buy projects that are not fully developed or are still waiting on mass adoption. In a bear market, most investors flock to safe haven assets and blue-chips, which have the least risk of decreasing in value. Though this does appear to be a sound strategy, another group of investors have a different mindset: buy the most speculative, yet promising, projects, since they offer the greatest growth potential and are likely to decrease more in the bear market. Indeed, projects such as Cardano and Polkadot, both of which are smart contract platforms without smart contracts, have taken a beating and are down about 50% from their all-time high. These coins and many others who are still in development or are yet to experience mass adoption offer the potential for massive gains, but also for great losses if their project does not become a success. Let\u2019s look at a couple of these coins and analyze the pros and cons of investing in them at their discounted prices. One of the highest speculative coins by market cap is Cardano, which hopes to be an Ethereum killer. Their technology is superb, and they offer everything that Ethereum 2.0 plans to offer and potentially more. At their current market capitalization of $50 billion, buying ADA is the same as buying ETH at $275. However, this is not as perfect as it seems, as the project is far from guaranteed to be a success. Even though their technology is superior to Ethereum\u2019s, they do not have a single smart contract, token, or dApp on their blockchain, due to there not being smart contract capability. This will be released sometime in 2021, but even then, it will be difficult for them to overtake Ethereum\u2019s first mover advantage. Projects that are coded in Ethereum\u2019s programming language may not want to move to a completely different blockchain, which would require an overhaul of their code. In the 2017 bullrun, two similar projects were ARK and NEO, both of which tried to be Ethereum killers but never lived up to their expectations and have failed to hit all-time highs since then. Though it is unfair to compare NEO to ADA simply due to them both being smart contract platforms, it is important to mention the risk in investing in this sector\u2019s secondary coins. For these reasons, Cardano is yet to be a blue-chip crypto, and falls into the speculative category with high risk and high reward.Much like Cardano, Solana is building a fast and reliable smart contract platform. Though they have lots of support and funding from Sam Bankman-Fried and the FTX exchange, they have to overcome the hurdle of getting developers and users onboard. This could come with FTX\u2019s support of the Serum decentralized exchange, but they still need to create an ecosystem of compelling dApps to have a chance to compete with Ethereum. Polkadot, which is planning to build an internet of interoperable blockchains, is also a speculative coin worth considering in this market dip. Like Cardano, they have great technology and partnerships, but have yet to release a working product, and as a result their success is to be determined. They are similar to ICON, an interoperability project who reached a high of $12 in the 2017 bullrun and could not break $3.50 in this previous bullrun.A project similar to Polkadot and the DOT token is Cosmos and the ATOM token, which has a significantly lower market capitalization but is closer to releasing their final product. Both are solid bets on the interoperability space, but it is impossible to choose a favorite without knowing which will be adopted and used the most. The Terra blockchain, which is run using the LUNA coin, plans to completely revolutionize the financial sector. Some of the groundbreaking decentralized applications building on the platform include Mirror Protocol, which allows for the minting of synthetic stocks, and Anchor Protocol, which gives an expected 20% APY on stablecoin deposits. The team behind Terra is also developing Alice, an application that plans to merge the traditional financial world with the blockchain. Though their technology is sound, the LUNA coin has no maximum supply and an undisclosed amount in the hands of private investors, which helps explain its 40% drop in the past week. They appear to be struggling with adoption, as even though the economics are sound on Mirror and Anchor, there are only a couple billion dollars locked on their blockchain, and a project cannot ever be successful without mass adoption. A final token to consider would be Aave Protocol\u2019s AAVE token. This token gives holders governance rights over all the funds locked in the Aave borrowing and lending protocol, which currently has over $14 billion locked. The ratio of the market cap of the AAVE token to the total value locked in the protocol is slightly less than .5, which may signify that the token is undervalued, as $5 in AAVE has governance rights over about $10 in the protocol. However, \u2018locked\u2019 is a strong term, as the funds in Aave can be removed at any time, and the value of governance is yet to be fully determined. Maybe the fair value for governance is 1:2, or maybe it is even lower, and AAVE will continue to fall until the market determines what this ratio is. This uncertainty is why AAVE is such a speculative investment, but it also offers large returns if the Aave platform continues to grow and investors begin to value governance more. Even though there seem to be a lot of great deals in the crypto market right now, absolute diligence needs to be done before buying, as a lot of projects may never reach another all-time high. These speculative coins and tokens, although not complete, offer investors a great chance at capturing the gains that everyone comes into crypto to find. They are by no means guaranteed, and their best days could be behind them. On the other hand, they may be the first to do a 100x in the next bull run, whenever that may be.

These coins have strong fundamentals, a proven track record, and a competitive edge that make them have the greatest potential for a strong rebound in the near future.According to Investopedia, a blue-chip stock is \u201ca huge company with an excellent reputation\u2026 typically, large well-established and financially sound companies that have operated for many years... generally the market leader.\u201d This type of analysis can be used in the cryptocurrency market in order to find the coins that have the best chance of making it through another bear cycle and reaching new all-time highs in the future. In these markets, there are no balance sheets that investors can look at in order to determine the fundamental value of a cryptocurrency, but there are ways to determine what cryptocurrencies are blue-chips and most likely to be around for a long time.To classify a blue-chip cryptocurrency, let\u2019s use four criteria: First, the cryptocurrency has to have been around for at least four years, almost half of the lifespan of the cryptocurrency market. Second, there has to be a working product that can be used today with little risk of hacks, and not just a whitepaper and a vision. Third, the project must be unique, and have an advantage over its competitors. Fourth, the token or coin has to be economically sound, and not subject to lots of inflation. These criteria help ensure that projects are not hype-based, have the potential to survive a bear market, and ensure that investor\u2019s funds are safe.The first and most obvious blue-chip crypto is Bitcoin. It is by far the most resilient cryptocurrency on the planet, and boasts a massive hash rate that ensures that the network is nearly guaranteed to be accurate and free of fraud. It also has survived every single crash, even after having been declared dead by news publications over 400 times. Even though it is not the fastest or cheapest payment solution, it has the first-mover advantage, and thus is the most well-known cryptocurrency. If history is any indicator, Bitcoin will continue to be the dominant crypto well into the near future. The second blue-chip is Ethereum. As the first smart contract platform, it has had a secure and working product for over five years, and has kept its title as the king of the smart contract platforms. After every crypto crash, Ethereum has come back stronger and reached new highs. Like Bitcoin, there are other technologically superior smart contract platforms, but they do not have nearly the same level of adoption and interest as Ethereum. It has more decentralized applications than all other platforms combined, and has major companies such as Visa looking at it for payment solutions. Furthermore, the release of Ethereum 2.0 will allow for incredibly fast and cheap transactions, along with proof-of-stake consensus, making it technologically superior over many other current smart contract platforms. Even though Cardano, Polkadot, Cosmos, and Solana are compelling options for the blue-chip list, none of them have their final working product, or enough experience in the market to call them blue-chips. A third blue-chip cryptocurrency is the privacy coin Monero. It has been around since 2014 and has also survived every major crash. The technology used by Monero is so complex and cryptographically secure that nobody, not even government agencies, have been able to break it and figure out data about transactions. Though it has had trouble with being delisted from major exchanges and being potentially banned by countries, it is undoubtedly the king of the privacy coins, thus representing a significant sector of the crypto market. It is a blue-chip due to its resiliency, groundbreaking technology, and fair inflation rate of 1% annually.One of the more controversial blue-chip picks is DAI, the stablecoin issued by MakerDAO on Ethereum. Even though it is a stablecoin, it has all the properties of a blue-chip crypto. It was created in 2017, and kept its price stable at $1 since its inception, never failing after flash crashes or long bear markets. For investors who want to keep their money stable in cryptocurrency without having to use a centralized solution like USDT or USDC, DAI is a great and secure option.The final blue-chip crypto is Chainlink. In order for smart contract platforms to access data that is off the blockchain, such as sports scores, coin prices, and many other data sources, they need to use an oracle that aggregates this data. Chainlink is the biggest decentralized oracle platform, and is heavily used on many smart contract platforms and dApps, including Uniswap, Binance, Matic, Tezos, Polkadot, Solana, and Aave. Even though that feels like an exhaustive list, it hardly scratches the surface of the projects that Chainlink is integrating with, and the list is best summed up as every smart contract platform except Cardano and Cosmos. This level of integration within the space means that LINK will be providing data for these blockchains for as long as they are around. Even though there are some notable omissions from this list, like Litecoin and Stellar, this list is filled with time-tested and fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies. Though their future cannot be guaranteed, they are all backed by hedge funds and institutional investors, and have the chance to lead the blockchain revolution for years to come.

Two of the biggest DEXes, Uniswap and Pancakeswap, may appear similar, but have quite different tokens. Uniswap is more of a stable and potentially overvalued investment, while Pancakeswap is higher risk, higher reward.Even though the markets are incredibly volatile right now, there is one thing that will always be constant: trading activity on exchanges. In order for investors to either buy the dip or panic sell during these tumultuous times, they have to go through an exchange. For privacy advocates and users who do not want to register with an exchange to buy and sell some of the top cryptocurrencies, decentralized exchanges offer a solution. Their liquidity comes from users depositing funds in order to receive a cut of the trading fees, and traders on the platform can keep their funds in their own wallets and transact without KYC. Due to their robust nature and improvements over centralized exchanges, many believe that they will be crucial in the future of the financial world.The two biggest decentralized exchanges, Uniswap and Pancakeswap, have tokens that investors can buy to own a piece of the protocol. Let\u2019s look at both of these projects and determine which one is the best bet to be the future of the decentralized exchange sector.Uniswap was released in 2018 on Ethereum and is widely considered to be one of the first liquidity provider-based decentralized exchanges. Uniswap V1 was meant as a proof of concept, and Uniswap V2, which was launched in May 2020, brought more security, more accurate prices, and greater optimization. Later in 2020, the Uniswap team released the UNI token, which acts as a governance token for the network and gives holders rights to vote on changes and upgrades to the protocol. Investors were immediately excited about this coin, and it quickly became a staple of the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market cap. Uniswap V3, which was released in May 2021, offers even more efficiency improvements and an eventual plan to move to Optimistic Ethereum, a scaling solution for Ethereum that will make fees for transactions almost nonexistent. This is incredibly crucial for the survival of Uniswap, as Ethereum\u2019s current congestion means that fees on Uniswap can be upwards of $100 per transaction.Pancakeswap was released in September 2020 on the Binance Smart Chain. The team is anonymous, and it is rumored that Binance had a role in its creation. They started as a fork of Uniswap, meaning they copied the code and created their own token to go along with it. Although they are technically a copy-and-pasted project, they have quickly grown to prominence and released unique features that Uniswap does not have. For example, liquidity providers on Pancakeswap not only get a cut of the trading fees, but they are also rewarded with CAKE, the governance token of the ecosystem. The CAKE rewards make LP staking incredibly lucrative, and can make the APY of liquidity providing reach above 400%. Another unique feature of Pancakeswap is that users can stake CAKE tokens and receive other tokens in return with massive APYs over 70%. They also offer a prediction market, lottery, and initial farm offerings, or IFOs, which are a new type of crowdsourcing model where users stake CAKE and BNB in order to receive tokens from a project. Naturally, these use cases for the token and the faster and cheaper nature of the Binance Smart Chain led to Pancakeswap gaining lots of traction since its release. In fact, the hype surrounding Pancakeswap got so high that it has surpassed Uniswap in transaction volume on multiple occasions, signaling to investors that Pancakeswap may be the future top DEX.Currently, the UNI token has a market capitalization of $11 billion, with an all-time high of $22 billion. The CAKE token has a market cap of $2.5 billion and an all-time high of $7 billion. If Pancakeswap is by all means better than Uniswap, why is there such a discrepancy in valuation?One of the most important metrics to look at when valuing a DeFi protocol is their total value locked, or TVL. This number represents the amount of funds locked into a DeFi protocol. Uniswap has a TVL of $5.3 billion and a market cap to TVL ratio of 2.2, while Pancakeswap has a TVL of $6.6 billion and a market cap to TVL ratio of 0.38. Since the tokens of a DeFi protocol are in charge of governing the funds locked in the platform, a project can be classified as fairly valued with a TVL to market cap ratio of 1, overvalued if the ratio is greater than 1, and undervalued if the market cap is less than 1.By this metric alone, it would seem that Uniswap is overvalued and Pancakeswap is significantly undervalued, but this does not tell the entire story. UNI has a higher valuation because it has institutional backing from firms like Coinbase Ventures and Pantera Capital. It also has a brighter future, and the release of V3 and their layer 2 implementation could bring massive trading volume back to the platform, as users will finally be able to transact cheaply. They also have a license on their code so that Pancakeswap cannot copy their work again. Furthermore, UNI has solid tokenomics and a capped maximum supply, meaning that inflation will not hurt the price of the token.On the other hand, Pancakeswap has large inflation and no maximum supply. Even though they plan to curb inflation and create scarcity for the token through burning, the fear of inflation and a valueless token scares some investors away from the platform. CAKE is also not listed on a wide array of exchanges, and does not appear to have the same recognition as its rival.That being said, if Pancakeswap is able to retain its current trading volume, it is bound to receive more attention from investors. It appears that CAKE has a lot more short-term potential than UNI and may be undervalued, while UNI has more long-term potential and fundamentally sound tokenomics. Even though it\u2019s easy to get caught in the tribalism of the cryptocurrency community and only choose one platform to support, the best investing decision may be to allocate a portion of one\u2019s investment to each platform, and cheer on both of them as they revolutionize the financial sector.

Fortunately, cryptocurrency has plenty of options, including lending cryptocurrencies, staking, and liquidity pool providing.Even though the cryptocurrency market somewhat recovered from its recent fall, almost every crypto is still down significantly from its all-time high, and there is no guarantee that everything will rebound quickly. In the meantime, investors who have gotten used to daily gains in the cryptocurrency market have begun looking for other opportunities to supplement their income. As one of the most disruptive and revolutionary financial tools in recent history, blockchains and cryptocurrencies are offering numerous opportunities for investors to make passive income, and they suit all levels of risk.One of the least riskiest ways to make passive income in the cryptocurrency market is through staking crypto on proof of stake blockchains. Proof of stake is a consensus method that allows blockchains to be secure and immutable. It is similar to mining cryptocurrencies using machines, which is known as proof of work, but instead of using computers, investors \u201cstake\u201d their cryptocurrency on the network and use it as collateral to confirm transactions. This is seen by many to be the future for cryptocurrencies, as it is both more efficient and environmentally friendly than mining.Almost all major smart contract blockchains allow for staking, including Binance Smart Chain, Cardano, Polkadot, and Solana. Additionally, Ethereum is currently moving to a proof of stake model in the near future, and investors can lock up their ETH with custodial services available on exchanges like Kraken and Binance in order to start earning staking rewards using their Ethereum. The rate of return, or ROI, of staking depends on the blockchain, and is usually not as good as it appears. For example, Polkadot advertises a 13% annual percent yield, or APY, but a lot of the DOT being given to stakers comes from the network\u2019s inflation, so the real APY is closer to 4%. Just because a coin has a high APY does not mean that it is a good investment. In fact, many DeFi coins that can be staked and offer staking APYs greater than 100% usually have lots of inflation, making them an unsafe place to store money in the long-term.It is important to choose a good and reputable custodian when staking. If the custodian makes an error or stops helping secure the network, your funds may be slashed. However, if one chooses a good staker and a cryptocurrency with strong fundamentals, staking is one of the easiest and risk-free ways to make passive income.Another way to make money with passive income is through DeFi protocols. There are two main opportunities available for investors. The first is depositing funds into a lending platform such as Aave or Compound. These platforms take tokens such as USDC, ETH, WBTC, and LINK, among others, and lend them out to borrowers who want to get overcollateralized loans. These yields are significantly higher than those in traditional bank savings accounts, and can be as high as 15-20% in some cases. For example, Terra\u2019s Anchor Protocol aims to achieve a 20% ROI for stablecoin deposits.The two main issues with lending money are the risks of the DeFi protocol getting hacked and the interest rate being variable and volatile, meaning that one day the 15% ROI could turn into a .1% ROI. For audited and well-known projects, the risk is minimal, but still there nonetheless.The other main opportunity in DeFi is depositing funds into liquidity pools, such as those on Uniswap or Pancakeswap. In traditional finance, when someone wants to use a stock trading platform like Fidelity or Robinhood, those platforms have to hold both the stock that a user wants to purchase along with dollars in case people want to sell. In the decentralized finance world, this obligation is given to liquidity pool providers, who can deposit two coins, such as ETH and USDC, into a liquidity pool and earn the trading fees from users using the exchange. For example, if someone deposits USDC and ETH into Uniswap, they will get a cut of the trading fee every time someone decides to buy ETH using USDC on Uniswap. On Pancakeswap and Sushiswap, these yields are even more lucrative, as they offer their CAKE and SUSHI tokens as an incentive to provide liquidity. This can lead to incredibly high APYs of 100% or greater on some token pairs.The main risk with liquidity providing is that there is the chance of impermanent loss. This happens when one token rises more than another, and it occurs because the liquidity pool has to keep a 1:1 ratio between each coin. So if the Etheruem price increases, and more people are buying ETH using USDC from the pool, the pool providers will have a larger portion of USDC than ETH, and would have made more money holding the assets outright. There is also the risk of a hack, like with any DeFi protocol. However, the token rewards on Pancakeswap and Sushiswap mitigate impermanent loss to a degree. Nonetheless, it is one of the more risky options presented.One final option to consider is centralized finance, or CeFi, lending through platforms such as BlockFi, Nexo, and Celsius. These platforms offer a stable interest rate on popular cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, and are sometimes insured against hacks. Unfortunately, these services require KYC and are subject to traditional banking laws, but can be a good option for people not experienced enough to feel comfortable with DeFi.  Just because the cryptocurrency market isn\u2019t increasing daily does not mean that there are no opportunities to receive a yield. Through DeFi platforms and staking opportunities, investors can rest assured that their assets are making them money while they sleep, and helping them achieve their goal of financial freedom.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3391361","Time":1621507870,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.056,"neu":0.824,"pos":0.12,"compound":0.9965,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.647,"pos_right":0.353,"compound_right":0.7184,"Total Score":0.954785},"51":{"Title":"What are the Do\u2019s and Don'ts of Investing in a Potential Bear Market","Content":"The cryptocurrency market is in a freefall. Bitcoin is now down 52% from its all-time high, and there has never been a time in Bitcoin\u2019s history where this type of price action did not lead to lower prices in the future, hinting at the possibility of a bear market. In order to maximize gains and minimize losses, investors should not invest with emotion, continue dollar cost averaging, and look for opportunities and discounts on coins with fundamental value.For all intents and purposes, the bull market is over. Whether this means the bear market has begun is up for debate, but according to historical data, it is fairly unlikely that Bitcoin recovers to hit new all-time highs anytime soon. The level of speculation over the past months has been incredibly high, and this is the correction that has been fated to happen, like it always does in every market. Take a look at this graph from 2017 and compare it to the Bitcoin price graph from today. Does it look familiar?Even though the crypto markets in early 2021 were incredibly easy to make money in, we now have to invest with much more diligence and research in order to not lose money daily. Here are some of the most important do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for investing in a time where the future is uncertain, but people still want to maximize their Bitcoin profits and believe in the long-term future of cryptocurrency.First, if you are using a dollar cost averaging, or DCA, strategy, don\u2019t stop because of the bear market. DCAing only works if it is used in both the bear and bull market. By continuing to buy as the prices fall, you are effectively lowering your average price, meaning that when Bitcoin does eventually rise back to new highs your profits will be greater. Stopping now would make no sense, which leads us into the next point:Don\u2019t invest with your emotions at the forefront of your decision-making. It\u2019s easy for some newly-minted crypto millionaires, or even those who now have over $100,000 in cryptocurrencies, to think emotionally about the amount of money they are losing. However, this is incredibly harmful, both for your health and your portfolio. By thinking with emotions, it\u2019s easy to panic sell everything and be left with a loss. Even though the short-term fluctuations of cryptocurrency are incredibly scary, it\u2019s easier to think about the new prices as a discount rather than a drop in value. Furthermore, cryptocurrency gains or losses are not set until money is taken out. If the market goes down and you don\u2019t cash out, there\u2019s still a chance it could rebound back to the initial price or higher, so it\u2019s not a true loss. During the bull market, almost anything that was remotely related to cryptocurrencies was increasing with price. This included the dog coins, clones of Uniswap, and many other fairly useless coins and tokens. As they say, \u201ca rising tide lifts all boats\u201d and this is definitely true for some of the worthless coins. Now, instead of buying whatever has some positive price action and hype on Reddit, it is better to do lots of diligent research before investing in a cryptocurrency. Those may be the only coins to recover, and the ones that people feel secure keeping their money in for the long-term. The best ways to do diligence on a coin are by reading the whitepaper, looking at different expert opinions, and understanding the team, tokenomics, and roadmap. If a project has an unknown team and little plans for the future, it may be a good idea to stay away from that coin.Even though for some it is tempting to buy a lot now and take advantage of the discounts, it is not advisable to try to \u201ccatch a falling knife\u201d and buy cryptocurrencies as they are falling. Nobody, no matter how confident they seem, knows when this freefall will end, and it could be a long while until the bottom price is set in. In the meantime, if people try to buy daily in order to buy the dip, they\u2019ll be left holding a lot of coins at a high average price. Waiting until the market trades sideways for a couple days will ensure that the coins are unlikely to go lower, thus making it a much more safe buying opportunity. Another important piece of advice to keep in mind is that even though the price is changing, the technology is not. Whether Ethereum is priced at $1,000 or $10,000, the team and their goal of creating the next generation of the internet will not change. They will continue working on ETH 2.0 throughout the bear market and never lose sight of their main goal. Companies like Microsoft, Visa, and Square, who are looking into blockchain as a business solution, will not stop looking simply because the price has gone down. Many of the most powerful world governments, including China, will not stop their rollout of a central bank digital currency simply because Bitcoin isn\u2019t worth what it used to be. The investors who bought at the top of the last bull market and held strong for the next three years have found themselves still up 50%, even after Bitcoin has plummeted. So, if active trading strategies are not your style, holding could still prove to be a time-tested way to make a profit in cryptocurrency.No matter the short-term price movement, the coins and team behind them will not change. This is why it is so important to ensure that your money is in projects you truly believe in instead of hype-fueled scams. No matter what happens in the next couple of months to next couple of years in the cryptocurrency market, innovations will continue happening, and investors can take advantage of the lower prices that they all wish they could\u2019ve had when they watched Ethereum and Bitcoin hit new highs earlier this year.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3386850","Time":1621408997,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.066,"neu":0.792,"pos":0.142,"compound":0.9978,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.4989},"52":{"Title":"Have we Hit the Top of the Bull Market","Content":"With Bitcoin and Ethereum both down over 25% from their all-time highs and FUD taking over the market, many investors are concerned that the market has already reached its peak, and is beginning to enter bearish territory. Though this is a valid concern, history tells us that cryptocurrencies may have some more room to grow, and the new wave of institutional investment may stop history from repeating itself.Ever since Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla would no longer be accepting Bitcoin as a payment method due to environmental concerns, the market has been in a freefall. Bitcoin has gone from a high of over $60,000 to struggling to stay above $40,000, and Ethereum has gone from $4,400 to $3,400 in less than a week. As always, the majority of other cryptocurrencies are also following the two market leaders, and causing losses across the market. This is concerning to some investors, who see this price action as the beginning of the end for the bear market, similar to how 2017\u2019s massive gains were followed by -20% days in early January, and the fear in the market is at a one-year high. For as long as Bitcoin has been around, it has seemed to follow a pattern of four years in bear market, then a massive bull market, usually following the Bitcoin halving. This was true in 2017, where the halving caused Bitcoin to increase nearly 20x to $20,000, then the bear market began and lasted until early 2021. Typically, these bull markets last for about a year or so until the market begins to begin its rapid descent. However, this current bull market has been going on for about six months. In theory, this should mean that there is another five or six months before investors should worry about a bear market, however this may not be the case.Additionally, it appears that a lot of the recent cryptocurrency demand is coming from retail investors trading on Robinhood. This is evident due to the massive increase in Dogecoin price, which was caused solely by retail investors and tweets from Elon Musk. Unlike institutional investors, retail investors are much more easily spooked by dips in prices, and a small decrease in Bitcoin or Dogecoin could cause a chain reaction whereby more and more retail traders sell their Bitcoin in order to cut their losses. Even though the retail investors are crucial in getting the price up to new highs, they also are also to blame for rapid decreases in price.On the other hand, with the inflow of institutional investment from the likes of Square, MicroStrategy, Tesla, and others, there seems to be a lot more Wall Street interest than previously. Furthermore, Bitcoin has hit new highs in terms of popularity and recognition, and is closer than ever to being the world\u2019s digital currency. This inflow of institutional investment may help to stabilize Bitcoin at higher prices, as companies like MicroStrategy buy tens of millions of dollars of Bitcoin whenever the price dips, and helps to legitimize the currency as worthy of its valuation. Unlike retail investors, companies and institutions tend to have a much longer outlook and one less fueled by short-term price fluctuations. The stability that these companies provide for Bitcoin could be crucial in the long-term propagation of this bull market. The technology of popular cryptocurrencies has also improved since the 2017 bull run, meaning there is more concrete reasoning behind the high valuations. In fact, Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, has been quoted saying that the 2017 price hike seemed to be fueled by speculation, and now there is a lot more fundamentally that makes Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies potentially deserve their market capitalizations, such as DeFi. Now that top cryptocurrencies are revealing working products, their valuation is less rooted in speculation, thus making the inevitable price fall have a chance of being less drastic. For example, Cardano reached $1 in the past bull run without even having a working blockchain, but now has reached over $2 with smart contracts slated to launch in the coming months.One of the most popular sayings for investors is that \u201chistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself\u201d and this could be true in this market in two different ways. One way would be that the market does not give us a year of bullish sentiment before decreasing, and that $60,000 was the top. The other possibility is that we are entering uncharted territory and that the bull market will last a lot longer than normal. Regardless, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies remains positive, and the price has zero effect on the technology or use-case. It is important to remember that the price drops won\u2019t stop world governments from looking into utilizing cryptocurrencies in their monetary policy, nor will it stop Visa from using Ethereum for payments. Though the short-term price is something that is easy to get caught up in, it is by no means the driving force for the blockchain technology that promises to one day revolutionize the financial industry.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3384162","Time":1621340091,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.032,"neu":0.894,"pos":0.074,"compound":0.9845,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.816,"pos_right":0.184,"compound_right":0.2023,"Total Score":0.86717},"53":{"Title":"As the Hype Dies Down, What\u2019s Next for NFTs","Content":"The NFT hype from Spring 2021 has begun to finally wind down, as many of the top NFT marketplaces have seen a staggering decline in monthly volume. Even though the days of virtual trading cards and artworks fetching multi-million dollar price tags might be over, there is still extremely high potential for NFTs in gaming, utility, and with real-world assets.In the early part of 2021, NFTs were the biggest alternative investment, and got coverage from all sorts of mainstream news outlets, like the Wall Street Journal and CNBC. They became so popular that people flocked to digital assets as a way to hedge against the uncertainty in the market, in a way similar to how people invest in trading cards or celebrity autographs. However, these levels of hype have died down significantly over the past couple of months. For example, NBA Top Shot, once the premiere NFT trading card platform, has seen the prices for some cards go down by 50% or more from their all-time highs. It is no longer possible to create an NFT out of thin air and demand multiple ETH for it, which was once possible when investors of no knowledge in the space were buying everything they could get their hands on.Fortunately, this does not spell the end for NFTs. Even though the trading card-esque NFTs with no underlying value were the most popular, there are many other forms of less popular NFTs that still have potential to create mainstream adoption and have real world use cases. One example of these types of NFTs are the utility NFTs seen in gaming and other sectors. For example, ZED RUN is a platform that allows people to buy, sell, race, and breed digital horses. These horse NFTs offer more than just a collector\u2019s item, but a real asset with profit-making potential. The horses can earn money in races, which are streamed on ZED\u2019s Twitch page for thousands of viewers, or be bred with other horses to make new ponies that can be sold on a secondary market or raced. These types of projects show that there is still lots of potential in the utility of NFTs, and that they can do much more than simply be a piece of art or a trading card.Another area related to gaming that NFTs are changing are cosmetic items in video games. Even though it seems crazy to some to spend real world money on video game cosmetic items, it is a billion-dollar industry, and is only poised to grow as gaming and esports in general continues to skyrocket in popularity. With NFTs, cosmetics and weapon skins can be taken from game-to-game, and sold on a secondary market instead of being a sunk cost by an individual. Enjin Coin is the main project building this gaming ecosystem. They have a marketplace where gamers can trade cosmetic items and weapons that can be used in a multitude of games. For example, there is a Binance hoodie item that can be used in a blockchain-based mobile game, Minecraft, and a web-based  game. If this technology was adopted by a large game such as Fortnite or World of Warcraft, NFTs would see a massive increase in adoption, and game publishers would be able to make a lot more money off their cosmetic items due to the hype surrounding NFTs.One of the more practical areas that can be disrupted by NFT technology is the tethering of items to digital assets. In our modern society, owning a house means that one owns a paper-based land deed giving the owner rights to a piece of land. There is no reason that this paper document cannot be substituted for one on the blockchain, which would allow its owner to have much more flexibility and security over its transfer. This application extends beyond real estate and into any asset that can be owned. On the blockchain, tokenized items could be bought, sold, and transferred with ease, or broken up into coins representing shares in the item and used in DeFi protocols. Not only could tangible items be stored as NFTs, but also digital media, such as songs, books, and movies. This is especially relevant in the field of college textbooks. Right now, illegally downloading and sharing digital textbooks is incredibly easy. In order for publishers to make money, they have no choice but to offer their textbooks as digital subscriptions, which is incredibly student unfriendly: students have to pay the same price for the textbook, but it only lasts a semester, as opposed to forever. If publishers minted their books as NFTs, students could buy them, then sell them to another student at the end of the semester, and due to the nature of the blockchain, it could not be duplicated and illegally shared. This offers a win-win situation, as publishers get to continue making profits without the worry of forgery, and students get to truly own their digital assets. Even though it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the hype of trading card and other functionally useless NFTs, the truth is that the real value lies in the potential for NFTs to be used in a multitude of different ways. As NFTs continue to grow in popularity and more companies and other entities begin taking advantage of their revolutionary immutable and blockchain-based properties, they will begin to become nearly universal in our everyday lives.

Their layer 1 blockchain can handle smart contracts at the speed of the internet at low fees, making it understandable why it immediately became a top 10 coin.In early May, users of Coinmarketcap were greeted by a surprising new entry into the Top 10: Internet Computer. This coin, which was created by Dfinity, recently had its mainnet genesis launch on May 7, which is a massive milestone for the project. Three days later, Internet Computer\u2019s ICP token began trading on nearly every large exchange, including Coinbase, Binance, and FTX. This type of coordinated listing rarely happens in the cryptocurrency space, so it naturally got investors excited about the prospects of ICP. Let\u2019s dive into the history, use case, and team behind Internet Computer to see if it deserves its lofty market cap of $37 billion.Internet Computer was created by Dfinity, headed by Dominic Williams, in 2016. They aim to create the next generation of the internet, and they wish to rival centralized competitors such as Amazon\u2019s Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. This means that anyone would be able to post whatever they want to the internet without the surveillance of Big Data or the possibility of censorship. Their method of bringing the internet to the blockchain also means that there is no need for costly backup procedures, firewalls, and security issues that plague the cloud-based systems we use today. The current internet uses IP, or internet protocol. This means that there are physical servers, or hosts, where software stays, and data is able to be transferred anywhere in the world. Dfinity has created the ICP, or Internet Computer Protocol, which removes the need for physical hosts and instead allows the entire internet to host and transfer both data and software. This is possible through the decentralization and a network of nodes around the world that store and transfer data.In our current system, hosts make money through both fees and selling user data to advertisers. One only has to look at Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica scandal for an example of why this is invasive and harmful for consumers. ICP changes this by ensuring that nodes have no control over the data hosted on them, which guarantees that they are unable to sell user data to advertisers. Instead, the nodes are paid in the ICP coin as an incentive to uphold the integrity of the network.Similar to Ethereum, the ICP token is used to pay for gas fees on the network. The fee is paid based on how many cycles, or CPU power, an application needs to run. Unlike Ethereum, whose gas fees are based directly on the price of Ethereum, the ICP gas fees are pegged to the price of the Swiss Franc, meaning that they should not increase with an increase in ICP price. The coin can also be locked in their Network Nervous System, or NNS, and used for governance features. The NNS gives more voting power to ICP coins that are staked longer, incentivizing users to stake their coins for long periods of time. The Dfinity team is made up of over 188 people, and some of them have impressive credentials which add to the legitimacy of the project. Some of their notable achievements include creating encryption algorithms, receiving PhDs from Stanford and other prestigious universities, and founding successful cryptocurrency exchanges. The fact that the Dfinity team is large and spread out across the world is a good sign that the project is not a scam and truly intends to build the future of the internet. Immediately after the coin\u2019s release on exchanges and listing on Coinmarketcap, the token price shot up to nearly $800, before correcting to around $300 and a market capitalization of nearly $40 billion. Even though this project has a lot of future potential, the fact that they have a massive market cap without a true working product makes it a potentially risky buy with not as much upside. The coin, like many others after being listed, may be slightly overhyped, and due for a correction to its true value in the near future. On the other hand, there are lots of cryptocurrencies with no working product and a large market cap, such as Cardano. It is difficult to tell if ICP is overvalued or simply such a groundbreaking idea that it already deserves a market cap almost as high as the automaker Ford.The Internet Computer is an interesting project attempting to revolutionize a field that is ripe for adoption. They are not a direct competitor to Ethereum or any other smart contract platforms, and have carved out their own niche in the cryptocurrency space. Their extensive 20-year roadmap states that they plan to eclipse Big Tech within the next 20 years. Only time will tell if the ICP will replace the internet we know today, but if the 188 team members are to be believed, this flippening is inevitable.

Since their inception, the cryptocurrency market has been incredibly volatile and irrational, as proven by Dogecoin\u2019s rise to the top 3 and Elon Musk\u2019s tweets causing pumps and dumps. This irrationality is mainly due to the nascency of cryptocurrencies and will be solved as the market matures and becomes more regulated. One of the most important characteristics of a currency is its stability. If everyone woke up one day with significantly more or less purchasing power than they had the day before, it would be nearly impossible to fairly transact with others. Even though this lowering of purchasing power does happen with government-backed currencies such as the U.S. dollar, the rate of inflation is fairly predictable and low, so that a millionaire may only wake up with a dollar or so less purchasing power than the day before.Bitcoin, whose goal is to be the world\u2019s reserve currency, experiences extreme price volatility. A move of 5-10% in a day, which would be unheard of in the S&P 500 or NASDAQ, is commonplace in crypto and leads to massive gains and losses happening seemingly overnight. As a result, having all of one\u2019s wealth in cryptocurrency proves to be risky, as the chance of waking up 10% more poor is a real concern. If a shop accepted Bitcoin, they would have to change their prices multiple times a day to remain competitive and keep making a profit.Alongside this large volatility comes the sheer irrationality of the market. Currently, Dogecoin, one of the most irrational and economically unsound cryptocurrencies on the market, has a valuation of over $50 billion. Similarly, a tweet from Elon Musk on May 12 stating that Tesla would not be moving their Bitcoin until it became more environmentally friendly led to over $200 billion of value leaving the cryptocurrency space. This is over 10 times the amount of Bitcoin that Tesla holds, and billions more than Musk\u2019s total net worth. Why does a market, which is supposed to be economically efficient and rational, act in such irrational ways?One of the most obvious reasons is the speculation and nascency of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has only been around for about 12 years, and only viewed as a serious asset for less than half of that time, so it would make sense that the asset is still in its price discovery phase. Unlike stocks, which have been around for hundreds of years and have concrete value based on them giving the holder rights to the future profits of a company, there is no such measure in Bitcoin. It\u2019s more similar to gold, which has been used as a medium of exchange for almost the entirety of human history and still experiences price volatility and speculation. As time goes on and the cryptocurrency market matures, the price will begin to become more stable and universally agreed upon. This maturation will come as more people begin to hold cryptocurrency, use it as a medium of exchange, and generally understand its value. Another driving factor in reducing the volatility of the market will be regulation by world governments. In the traditional stock market, people who hold lots of stock are usually subject to regulation about when they can sell and the public reporting of these sales. However, in the cryptocurrency market, anyone can sell at any time without any sort of legal repercussions, meaning that the whale who holds 28% of the Dogecoin supply could sell everything they own and crash the price without any consequences. Similarly, large companies or influential individuals have no rules about what they can or cannot say or do related to cryptocurrencies. For example, J.P. Morgan could buy lots of Bitcoin, announce Bitcoin-positive news, then dump the Bitcoin on unsuspecting investors. Studies have shown that similar price manipulation is what brought Bitcoin to its high of $20,000 in late 2017.This manipulation is also evident in the price action after tweets by Elon Musk. He is one of the main reasons that Dogecoin has reached such a monumental valuation, as he frequently Tweets about the coin to his millions of followers. Unsuspecting retail investors, assuming that Musk knows what he is talking about and truly believes that DOGE will dethrone Bitcoin, buy the coin, leading to a massive pump. It is more likely that he is simply being ironic or satirical, and his followers are not picking up on it. Musk has gotten in trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission for tweeting about Tesla\u2019s stock before, but in the cryptocurrency world, this type of manipulation is completely legal, and causes irrational increases and decreases across the market. As cryptocurrencies become more prevalent in our society, governments will have no choice but to regulate them to protect investors. When this happens, lots of the scams and manipulation taking place behind the scenes will disappear, and massive pump and dump schemes will stop taking place. Furthermore, the volatility of cryptocurrencies will also decrease, as regulation will cause less speculation about government actions towards crypto, and it will achieve a similar status to gold.Even though regulation seems like the natural enemy of the cryptocurrency market, it will ultimately cause less speculation and manipulation, but may cause crypto to stop making millionaire investors overnight. A difficult tradeoff, but a necessary one for cryptocurrencies to become a staple of our modern financial world.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3372983","Time":1620908785,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.076,"neu":0.865,"pos":0.059,"compound":-0.971,"neg_right":0.152,"neu_right":0.683,"pos_right":0.165,"compound_right":0.0609,"Total Score":-0.816215},"56":{"Title":"Response to Musk: Will Bitcoin\u2019s Environmental Unfriendliness be its Downfall","Content":"Recently, Bitcoin\u2019s electricity usage and impact on climate change, which stems from its proof of work algorithm, has been called into question by environmentalists and big names such as Elon Musk. Fortunately, this problem will not be the death knell of Bitcoin, and the forces of economics should correct this issue before too much damage is done.On May 12, at 5pm EDT, Elon Musk released a tweet stating that Telsa will not move their Bitcoin until it is more environmentally friendly, and that they are looking for alternative cryptocurrencies that do not have such an adverse impact on the environment. Almost immediately, the market reacted irrationally, and the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies dropped by nearly 10% in a matter of hours. The fact that one person has this much control over a $2 trillion dollar market is an issue to discuss another time, but he does bring up an important point about the proof of work algorithm and Bitcoin\u2019s future in a world concerned about climate change and sustainability. Bitcoin uses proof of work as its consensus method. What this means is that people from around the world use computing power in order to confirm transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, and receive BTC as a reward for their efforts. Naturally, all of this computing power uses a significant amount of electricity. In fact, one Bitcoin transaction takes as much energy as it takes to power 20 United States homes for a day, according to some sources. The total amount of energy used by Bitcoin is estimated to be around 0.55% of worldwide electricity usage. This is an incredibly high amount of energy consumption, and some argue that it is not worth the cost. Even more worrisome is that some of this energy comes from coal and other fossil fuels, which release lots of pollutants into the atmosphere. If this level of pollution keeps up, and Bitcoin continues to grow, this could mean that there is a copious amount of pollution coming directly from Bitcoin, which would make it difficult for investors and governments alike to get behind the currency. Fortunately, there are solutions for Bitcoin that will mitigate this risk to worldwide adoption. First, there are the economic incentives in place for miners to use alternate sources of energy. Like any rational actor, cryptocurrency miners want to minimize cost and maximize profits. Luckily for the environment, some of the cheapest sources of energy are renewable, such as hydroelectric and geothermal energy. This is why a large portion of miners are situated in China\u2019s Yunnan and Suchan provinces, where there is ample hydroelectric power. Over the coming years, as more governments condemn coal usage and offer more opportunities for renewable sources of electricities, more miners will begin moving to the places offering these resources and taking advantage of the lower prices, which will raise their profits. It must be conceded that presently, coal is an extremely cheap energy resource, and as a result it is being used by a lot of miners. This is a real issue with Bitcoin, and the only way for it to go away is with government intervention, which seems to be happening slowly but surely around the world. In fact, China\u2019s Inner Mongolian region, where a lot of coal-based mining takes place, is planning to ban cryptocurrency mining in order to cut down on energy consumption. Examples like this show that governments are moving in the right direction.Another solution to Bitcoin\u2019s electricity problem would be to move to proof of stake. Unlike the energy-intensive proof of work mining process, proof of stake simply involves people using their Bitcoins as collateral in order to secure the network. For example, let\u2019s say Bob stakes 1 Bitcoin for the proof of stake method. Now, instead of his computer completing complicated math problems to solve transactions, it simply looks at them and confirms whether or not they are valid. If Bob says a transaction is valid when the rest of the network doesn\u2019t, his 1 Bitcoin will never be returned to him, so he is incentivized to act honestly. It is possible that Bitcoin moves to this model through an upgrade to the network, but it is fairly unlikely, because Bitcoin miners would never agree to make their business model obsolete. Instead, Tesla and others could move to a more environmentally friendly blockchain, such as Ethereum after their proof of stake upgrade, which is estimated to be released in 2022. Another option would be Algorand, an Ethereum competitor, which pledges to be one of the world\u2019s first carbon negative blockchains. As ethical investing continues to become more popular, blockchains like Algorand can expect to have a significant advantage in attracting investors and making themselves appealing to governments. Even though Elon Musk\u2019s tweet brings up an important conversation that needs to be had in the cryptocurrency space, it is not an issue that cannot be fixed. Through the diligent efforts of governments and environmentally-conscious individuals, the problems of Bitcoin\u2019s electricity consumption can be dealt with through natural economic forces and incentives.

An Analysis of the Market Bubble","Content":"With the total cryptocurrency market capitalization recently breaking $2 trillion, many are left wondering whether this market is entirely a bubble or if this valuation is deserved. Though there are lots of strong projects in the cryptocurrency space that are nearly guaranteed to disrupt industries and be a mainstay in our society, they may not deserve their current market cap, and many others do not deserve theirs at all.Every single time cryptocurrencies are mentioned in the news, investors always have one question on their mind: is this market a bubble? It seems crazy to think that a digital currency, which has no backing from any government and cannot be held physically, has a valuation of over a trillion dollars, and still has some speculators thinking it will be valued as high as $10 trillion. Even though the answer to this question is incredibly tricky to pinpoint with complete accuracy, let\u2019s take a look at some of the reasons behind the belief that cryptocurrencies are overvalued, then see why others think they are still undervalued.One of the reasons that putting an accurate valuation on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is so difficult is the fact that they are a completely new asset class. With stocks, which represent shares in a company, one can look at the company\u2019s profits in order to determine how much an investor can expect to receive in profits from that company. With cryptocurrencies, holders are not entitled to profits, and at first glance there seems to be no fundamental value or benefit to holding them, besides holding a piece of digital money. Furthermore, it appears that there is no reason for the price to increase or decrease day-to-day, and holders are speculating about the future happenings of the currency, such as whether or not it will be adopted by merchants or put in the investment portfolio of a large company. With this constant speculation and future-oriented mindset, it\u2019s hard to see why Bitcoin deserves the market capitalization it has today. An argument made for Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is that it will one day be accepted and used universally, but that does not explain why it is worth $1 trillion today, other than pure speculation.This type of future speculation can be seen everywhere in the space. For example, Cardano, the smart contract platform that plans to beat Ethereum, has a market capitalization of $40 billion, more than many profitable companies, without even having smart contract functionality or a single application built using its ecosystem. The valuation at the moment is fundamentally baseless, and relies solely on the future potential of the project. When retail investors see the high price, instead of thinking the project is overvalued, they get FOMO and decide to buy more, leading to an even more outrageous valuation.Additionally, when removing the name-brand value from Bitcoin, it is simply an expensive way to send money around the world. This can be done by any cryptocurrency, regardless how big the market capitalization. The only thing that a trillion dollars does for Bitcoin is allow it to be accepted more universally and for billion-dollar transfers to take place. Besides those two benefits, any cryptocurrency can do what Bitcoin does with a fraction of the market cap.Another reason to be wary of a cryptocurrency bubble is the number of scam or illegitimate projects with massive market caps. One has to look no further than Dogecoin for an example of a project with no fundamental value and a sky-high market capitalization of $34 billion. If a meme project can reach $34 billion effortlessly, how can we trust that any other cryptocurrency is fairly valued? After looking at these few reasons, it is easy to see why some see cryptocurrencies as overvalued. However, there are others who think that their current valuation is more than deserved, and that these prices will actually be seen as incredibly low in the future. The $1 trillion dollar market cap of Bitcoin looks incredibly small when compared to its full potential. If Bitcoin truly becomes the world\u2019s digital gold, if a market capitalization of ten, if not one hundred, trillion dollars is feasible. Furthermore, if a project like Cardano is able to kill Etheruem and become the basis for the next generation of the internet, its true worth is nearly impossible to calculate. The following graph is outdated in terms of cryptocurrency market cap, but still demonstrates how much room there is to grow for the asset class.Even though it\u2019s easy to say that Bitcoin does not deserve its market cap due to its slow transaction times and high fees, there is one important fact that investors are forgetting: the Bitcoin blockchain is the most secure and provably legitimate document in all of human history. Every transaction, once written on the Bitcoin blockchain, is confirmed and stored by tens of thousands of validators all over the world, and left there for as long as their storage is around. This level of trust and security available is incredibly valuable, and allows for transfer of money and trust at a level which has never been seen before in the financial world. Even though some smaller projects are fundamentally worthless but have billions of dollars in market capitalization, this does not mean that the entire market is overvalued. And even if some projects today carry a market capitalization higher than they are worth as of today, constant developments mean that projects are continually improving, and will one day hope to live up to their current market cap. A problem only arises when, for example, investors buy ETH today in hopes of the release of Ethereum 2.0, raising the price, and then the price rises again because of the release. However, if this happened, it would not necessarily mean that investors are overvaluing Ethereum, but that they believe it carries a premium value based on its potential.With the current state of the cryptocurrency market, it is easy to see that a bubble is forming, due to the high levels of speculation by both retail and professional investors. However, it is impossible to know the size of the bubble, and when, and if, it will pop. Accurately valuing Bitcoin or Etheruem is as difficult as valuing the internet itself. The best course of action for current investors would be to do diligent research on every cryptocurrency, and ensure that they see a fundamental value and strong future potential worthy of its current market cap.

They are controlled by one entity, a bank, but bring some of the benefits of a blockchain, like cheap transactions and fast finality. With countries like the Bahamas, China, and the United States working on prototypes, there could be major changes in the way that we bank in the near future. Ever since the proliferation of Bitcoin into the mainstream, governments around the world have been attempting to find a way to utilize its revolutionary technology in a way that will benefit their countries. This has led to the creation of the central bank digital currency, or CBDC. Though the term and idea are still very new, so the definition is still somewhat vague, a CBDC is basically a digital currency issued by a government, backed by the central bank. Right now, there is no native way to send USD from one person to another over the internet. There are services like PayPal and Venmo, but these companies act as the middleman and handle the transfers. There is no way to send money from person A to person B like would be possible in person. CBDCs hope to change this by creating a government-backed centralized blockchain, allowing anyone to send money to one another over the internet quickly and cheaply. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, or many other blockchains, the blockchain that a CBDC is based on is centralized and controlled by the government. This means that there is a possibility for governments to chargeback transactions if there are hacks, scams, or other unforeseen circumstances. They also have control over the coin and can print more at their discretion, like with paper fiat currency. The first country to have a successful implementation of a CBDC was the island country of the Bahamas. Their Sand Dollar digital currency can be used through a state-created phone app, and allows anyone in the Bahamas to transact using the currency. For people who hold small amounts of the Sand Dollar, KYC is not needed, but it is for higher amounts. Unfortunately, the Sand Dollar is region-locked to the Bahamas, so people outside of the area cannot use the coin. Almost a year after release, the Sand Dollar has had much success in its implementation and development, and is nearing a full commercial rollout within the coming months. One of the most interesting facts about the Sand Dollar is that it is actually pegged to the US dollar, effectively making it a trial run of a United States CBDC. If everything continues to go as planned with the Bahamas, the United States will certainly take note. CBDCs offer lots of benefits, both to consumers and governments, but also have their fair share of drawbacks as well. One of the biggest benefits would be the potential to create a completely cashless society where anyone can send money to anyone else without the worry of price volatility, high fees, or long transaction times. Though this was also Bitcoin\u2019s main intention, and there are stablecoins on smart contract platforms like Etheruem and Stellar which allow this today, the full faith and trust of the U.S. government is important to a lot of consumers, and these privately-backed stablecoins cannot guarantee that they will keep their peg or continue to be unregulated. The security that comes with a government-backed digital dollar would bring lots of people into the cashless blockchain ecosystem. One of the biggest concerns for users of a CBDC is also one of the biggest advantages for the government: full visibility of every transaction. When a transaction takes place in cash, the government has no idea that it happened, and as a result cannot effectively tax it. However, when every transaction is recorded in a ledger, along with the amount and social security numbers of the people involved, it becomes impossible not to tax. This newfound declaration of every transaction could lead to billions in more in tax dollars for governments around the world. Along with the tax money, governments will also be able to determine and block suspicious or illegal transactions, leading to greater control over their citizens. Obviously, this would have massive negative implications for the consumer. Not many people want the government to know about every single transaction they make, big and small, and be required to pay taxes on them. As a result, the CBDCs will bring a large invasion of privacy to users, who will either accept it as an inevitable tradeoff for the efficiency of CBDCs or stick to traditional methods of payment for as long as possible. With sixty to eighty percent of central banks researching CBDCs, their implementation in some of the world\u2019s largest currencies seems inevitable. With this will come greater efficiency and ease of use for citizens, at the cost of privacy and tax money. Even though the CBDC may be a net negative for society as a whole, it will make people more aware of the alternative forms of payment and money, such as Bitcoin, and have a positive influence over the blockchain ecosystem as a whole.

However, this is far from the truth, and the high inflation, strong centralization, and lack of fundamentals make Dogecoin one of the least sound investments in the cryptocurrency space. When Dogecoin was created in 2013 by Jackson Palmer, he intended the coin to be a light-hearted joke. It stayed a simple meme in the cryptocurrency space for the better part of its existence, always staying somewhat relevant but never being seen as a true investment. However, in July 2020, the social media app TikTok began attempting to raise the price of 1 dogecoin to $1, and investors began buying it, thinking it was the next Bitcoin. This hype was only further fueled by billionaire Elon Musk constantly tweeting about Dogecoin\u2019s promise to revolutionize the financial system. Though many saw this as an ironic joke, many more saw it as a fact, and began buying even more DOGE, leading the price to increase 18,000%.As of today, the market capitalization of the coin is above $40 billion, nearly the same as Ford, DoorDash, and Chiptole. However, unlike the companies, which are based on revenues, fundamental value, and future prospects, the valuation of Doge is purely based on hype and speculation.Unlike Bitcoin or Litecoin, Dogecoin has no capped number of tokens, meaning that the supply will increase by a certain percentage every year. Right now, DOGE experiences a nearly 5% inflation rate, and 10,000 coins are mined every minute. For the price to stay exactly the same over the entire year, DOGE has to increase by at least 5%, otherwise the price will drop due to the laws of supply and demand. More supply means less demand, which means less price. Not only is the supply constantly increasing, but the Dogecoin network is not a revolutionary payments solution. Currently, the Dogecoin network can handle 33 transactions per second. Although this is higher than Bitcoin\u2019s 10, it is significantly less than what is ideal for a payment network, and lags behind almost every other coin in the top 10. This means that no businesses will have \u201cDogecoin accepted here\u201d in their window anytime soon. And with payments being Dogecoin\u2019s only feature, there is not much hope for the project in its current state. Being its own blockchain, one would think that one of Dogecoin\u2019s strengths is the hashing power dedicated to the network. However, Dogecoin uses a consensus method that relies on merged mining with Litecoin, meaning they piggyback off of Litecoin\u2019s miners, and miners of Litecoin receive both LTC and DOGE as a reward. Though this is a positive, as it means that the incentives of the Dogecoin network are directly tied to Litecoin, it also means that Dogecoin has no strong security of its own, and also that LTC miners have no incentive to hold their DOGE, as it it simply an added bonus to what they are already getting by mining Litecoin. With decentralized cryptocurrencies, one would expect that there is a somewhat fair distribution of coins, and that there aren't a few people who hold a majority of the coins. However, the opposite is true for Dogecoin: one single address holds 28% of the total supply. At any moment, this person could choose to dump all of their coins on the market, and completely crash the price. Unlike traditional markets, where someone with this level of control over a stock would be under the jurisdiction of the SEC, there would be no legal repercussions for this person if they decided to sell everything. When the top 12 addresses are considered, they hold nearly 50% of the total coins. Such a massive amount of control over the price by only a few addresses should be a scary thought for anyone holding DOGE. When each of Doge\u2019s shortcomings is considered on its own, they are seen as small concerns, but a red flag for the project nonetheless. When they are all considered together, one can see why Dogecoin does not deserve their sky-high market cap and that it is based on pure hype and not true fundamentals. Even though this height could propel it to $1 if enough people believe in it and continue buying, this irrational price will eventually come crashing down, and millions of investors will be left holding near-worthless coins.

If Coinbase continues at their current pace of innovation and keeps their dominance of the United States cryptocurrency market, there is a chance that they could have a similar hold to what Amazon has in shopping. However, they have competitors who may be more suited for that title, such as Binance. There was lots of hype and speculation leading up to the April 14 direct listing of Coinbase onto the United States-based Nasdaq stock exchange. On its first day of trading, COIN closed at a price nearly 30% higher than where it started the day, signaling to many that cryptocurrencies are here to stay on Wall Street. Some called their debut an \u201cAmazon moment\u201d for cryptocurrencies, and others say Coinbase will be the Amazon of cryptocurrencies. However, does Coinbase have what it takes to be the Amazon of crypto? Let\u2019s take a look at future price potential, features, and competitors of Coinbase to determine whether or not this prestigious title is theirs for the taking.For the average investor, finding the next Amazon is a dream goal: it means 10,000% return on investment and an early retirement. Unfortunately, Coinbase is not the next Amazon in this regard. With a market capitalization already over $60 billion, it is far from a small company with 100x gains in its future. When Amazon held their initial public listing in 1997, it was only valued around $1 billion, which gave investors much larger potential for gains. For Coinbase to reach Amazon\u2019s market cap, their stock price would only go up 28x. An impressive amount, indeed, but nothing compared to the 1290x that Amazon has done to date.Even though it\u2019s unlikely that any investors will be retiring off Coinbase stock anytime soon, that doesn\u2019t mean that the company cannot one day have the same influence and dominance over cryptocurrencies that Amazon has over shopping and web services. Currently, Coinbase offers an impressive suite of financial tools, including a professional custodial service, regulated exchange of some of the top cryptocurrencies, and a commerce app to allow anyone to accept cryptocurrencies at their business. They also plan to offer a Visa card in the near future that users can use to spend cryptocurrencies at any merchant that accepts Visa. Furthermore, they have a venture capital arm, called Coinbase Ventures, that invests in new and promising blockchain companies. They are also associated with USDC, one of the largest stablecoins, and thus have some level of control over decisions relating to the token. All of these features are being used by over 56 million users, and Coinbase holds $223 billion of assets on their platform. Even though these are the current Coinbase offerings, it\u2019s highly likely that they are working on many other features and revenue streams for the company. The current state of the company is incredibly impressive, and any future ventures will only add onto their impressive resum\u00e9. This is eerily similar to Amazon\u2019s business model, where they enter as many different sectors as possible, including technology, commerce, and web services. In this regard, Coinbase stands a good chance of becoming the Amazon of crypto, due to their large suite of offerings, large user adoption, and future developments.Amazon would not have reached the status as one of the most dominant companies in the world had it not been for its constant innovation and features that set it apart from the competition. There is only one competitor to Coinbase that poses a serious threat to their worldwide crypto dominance: Binance. With a presence on every continent, Binance is arguably the largest exchange in the world, and they have a massive set of projects and branches of their company. Not only do they have a centralized exchange with hundreds of coins, tokenized stocks, and futures, they also have a decentralized exchange based on their own blockchain and token, Binance Coin, which has quickly shot up to be #3 in terms of market cap, at $100 billion. Furthermore, they already offer cryptocurrency Visa cards, have a venture capital arm, and work with emerging cryptocurrencies to allow them to do initial exchange offerings, or IEOs, on their platform. They even own Coinmarketcap, the most popular crypto price tracker. All of these features, on top of their massive worldwide user base and any unplanned features make Binance a serious threat to Coinbase\u2019s dominance. Fortunately, it is not too late for Coinbase to catch Binance in terms of market share and products, especially now that they are public and have a massive amount of capital to work with. If Coinbase can release similar features to Binance\u2019s, while also continuing to create unique innovations that revolutionize the cryptocurrency space, then they would easily claim the title as the Amazon of crypto. However, this is much more difficult than it seems, and is in no way guaranteed.Even though Coinbase is currently in a promising position to be the Amazon of crypto, they are not yet holding this title, and will not until they can prove their dominance over competitors. This will be proven through continued innovation and making themselves an uncatchable competitor in the cryptocurrency space. Even though investors won\u2019t make 1000x gains on their Coinbase stock, they can rest assured that their money is in good hands in one of the biggest cryptocurrency companies in the world.

With a valuation ranging anywhere from $20 billion to $230 billion, there is lots of speculation about how the company will be received by Wall Street. Regardless, the successful listing of Coinbase will lead to greater exposure, mainstream interest, and more realistic valuations for the cryptocurrency industry.When Coinbase begins trading under the COIN ticker at 9:00am Eastern Time on Wednesday, April 14, the cryptocurrency world will reach a significant milestone: the first cryptocurrency company will have successfully gone public. As the main exchange for United States-based traders, Coinbase has cemented itself as the Robinhood of crypto and is every new investor\u2019s go-to exchange due to their recognition, safety, and offerings. As a result, the valuation for the company has seen incredibly high estimates, sometimes as high as $230 billion. To put this into perspective, AT&T is worth $266 billion, and Nasdaq, the company that runs the stock exchange on which Coinbase will be listed, is worth $25 billion.Many investors think that the market capitalization of Coinbase is ridiculously high, and they might possibly be right. Recently, tech companies enter the market with high valuations, and then significantly drop after a couple weeks on the market. For example, Uber\u2019s price fell by 8% on it\u2019s first day of trading, and it took Uber nearly a year to reach a price higher than their IPO price. Additionally, Peloton\u2019s stock fell 11% on it\u2019s first day on the Nasdaq. The fact that Coinbase only specializes in cryptocurrencies only helps bolster the argument that their valuation, much like the entire cryptocurrency market, is fueled by baseless speculation, and does not reflect the business in its current state.On the other hand, some investors are convinced that Coinbase will be the \u201cAmazon of Crypto.\u201d They already have the largest market reach in the United States, and are continuing to gain ground overseas as well. Furthermore, they offer a commerce platform for businesses to accept cryptocurrencies, offer custodial services for institutions interested in holding cryptocurrencies, and have over $200 billion in cryptocurrencies held on their platform. This dominance gives them significant power over the cryptocurrency sector, and as the only publicly-traded company directly dealing in cryptocurrencies, their success correlates to the success of the market as a whole. As they continue to innovate, their dominance will only grow, and investors will see them as a way to invest in cryptocurrencies through a company, which is less risky for Wall Street than Bitcoin itself. If Coinbase lives up to their massive valuation expectations, the entire cryptocurrency market will win as a result. With such a high valuation on a centralized exchange, tokens for other centralized exchanges like Binance\u2019s BNB, FTX\u2019s FTT, KuCoin\u2019s KCS, and others will see a surge in interest from investors looking to find the next Coinbase. Moreover, this excitement over exchanges may also help increase the market capitalization of cryptocurrencies as a whole, and investors may become more aware of cryptocurrencies as an investment opportunity. On the other hand, if Coinbase drops significantly in value, there could be lasting impacts on the rest of the market. Holders of centralized exchange coins may fear that the companies are overvalued, and sell while they still can, which would lead to a large drop in price. It may even make some believe that the entire cryptocurrency market is overvalued and experiencing a price bubble. If Wall Street is not interested in the first cryptocurrency company, it is easy to assume that they are not interested in Bitcoin, either. Regardless of the result of Coinbase\u2019s stock price, there will be positive takeaways for the crypto sector. First, companies and cryptocurrencies will get more realistic valuations based off of Coinbase, which will lead to less volatility in the market. Second, every investor will now have to look at Coinbase, therefore cryptocurrencies, as a viable opportunity. Finally, cryptocurrencies will be respected more by mainstream investors. When a company solely focusing on the crypto markets is able to receive a valuation higher than traditional stock exchanges, people will have to respect the business model.For the weeks after April 14, the fate of the cryptocurrency market will be in the hands of Coinbase. If all goes to plan and their listing is a success, it will be a day of celebration for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, and signal many more future listings from the likes of Kraken, Binance, and other large names in the cryptocurrency space. However, if the price of COIN falls, the entire market may be facing significant repercussions. One thing is for certain: the day is incredibly significant for everyone in cryptocurrency, whether or not they have ever used Coinbase.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3299561","Time":1618167347,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.016,"neu":0.831,"pos":0.153,"compound":0.9986,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.4993},"66":{"Title":"First ICOs, Then DeFi, Now NFTs: What will Blockchain Disrupt Next","Content":"About once a year, one aspect of blockchain technology seems to grasp the attention of mainstream media and the public, and results in cryptocurrencies skyrocketing in value. After the current NFT hype cycle ends, signs are pointing to the fact that business use-cases for blockchain may be the next big wave of investment.In 2017, blockchain and cryptocurrencies became a household name due to the ICO craze that led to projects raising hundreds of millions of dollars. In summer 2020, blockchain once again became prevalent due to DeFi and yield farming\u2019s 1000% gains. Most recently, in early 2021, NFTs have become a household topic, and brought blockchain to heights never-before-seen. Anyone who invested in these sectors before they blew up have seen monumental gains, sometimes higher than 100x return on investment. As such, there is a lot of speculation about which industry or sector of blockchain will catch the public\u2019s attention next. If it can be successfully found, early investors could make enough money to retire, so the stakes are high enough to warrant a thorough investigation. One only has to look at Enjin Coin, which was created during the 2017 ICO craze and is an NFT platform, to see how significant these gains can be.One of the areas that blockchain can impact the most, but has seen little real-world use up to this point, is business and business-to-business, or B2B, applications. As of now, there are still lots of inefficient and legacy-based systems in place that cost businesses billions of dollars every year. If these businesses implemented blockchains and smart contracts into their companies, they would see these inefficiencies disappear, and as a result, increase profits significantly. Let\u2019s look at a few examples of what these inefficiencies are, how they can be addressed, and what projects are working in these areas.One of the most obvious areas of inefficiency that can be fixed with blockchain are the legal and contractual processes and associated fees. Any time that a business, or even a person, enters a legally-binding agreement, they go through a lawyer or escrow service and pay a hefty fee just to ensure that the agreement will go as planned. With smart contracts, these legal processes can be replaced by code, and anyone can collaborate with anyone else without any worry of fraud or a lack of trust. By eliminating these fee-charging middlemen, businesses can save lots of money on transactions, and actually be incentivized to collaborate more, since it costs them nothing and leads to more profits. Ethereum and other smart contract platforms would allow businesses to automate the creation and fulfillment of contracts. Additionally, LTO Network is a project focused on improving business efficiency in Europe. They already have platforms allowing for blockchain-based digital signatures, inspection reports, notary services, and legal contracts. This could save millions, if not billions, of dollars for businesses around the world, and thus LTO and related projects, like Ontology, appear to have a bright future. Another area that almost every business could use blockchain in is supply chain management. When a product is created, starting from being natural resources to manufacturing to the store shelves, it goes through a series of steps, and at each step a company documents the product\u2019s state as it goes through the supply chain. Currently, each step in the supply chain process is centralized, and it is difficult to determine if someone makes a fraudulent claim. Furthermore, due to being centralized, supply chain data can be changed and manipulated after the fact, leading to even more fraudulent results that a consumer cannot trust. By being decentralized and immutable, blockchain solves this problem and would increase transparency and security for businesses. VeChain is the largest project creating a blockchain-based supply chain management system. Their solution is already being used in the real world. In fact, there are wine bottles with VeChain QR codes on them that give accurate and transparent information about everything related to the bottle, so consumers can rest assured that the wine they are buying is legitimate. This technology will become prevalent in other goods as well, and lead to a more transparent, efficient, and trustless supply chain system.One final use case is in the fundamental structure of a business. Most businesses are governed by a board of directors which make every decision about the business. Though this works fine in some situations, it is not a democratic process, and people who hold shares in the company have little say over how the day-to-day operations are run, and cannot add any real value to the business. On the other hand, a blockchain-based DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is based on the principle that everyone who owns a piece of the company should have a say in how it is run. Instead of having a board of directors, with each director having a multi-million dollar salary that is hardly deserved, every person who owns a share of the company can propose a change or vote on governance decisions. This creates a more fair and efficient business model, and incentivizes the shareholders to help increase profits for the company. MetisDAO is one cryptocurrency project focusing on this area. They allow anyone to easily port their application or business to a DAO structure, and reap the benefits that it offers. Another project working in this ecosystem is DAO Maker, who act as a startup incubator and allow anyone to invest in upcoming DAOs.Blockchain offers billions of dollars in benefits to companies, and it is only a matter of time until it is adopted in order to decrease costs and increase profits. If this use-case takes off in the same way that ICOs, DeFi, or NFTs have, there will be multiple billion-dollar projects building these solutions, and the investors lucky enough to find them first will be able to retire early.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3297618","Time":1618076362,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.035,"neu":0.792,"pos":0.172,"compound":0.9992,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.4996},"67":{"Title":"Optimistic Ethereum Versus Polygon: Which Will Scale Ethereum Better","Content":"Ethereum has a scaling problem: Transactions on the network are slow and can have incredibly high costs, sometimes upwards of $100 to use a decentralized exchange. Fortunately Optimism and Polygon plan to help scale Ethereum, but each solution has their own method, pros, and cons. Ethereum\u2019s goal is to be the world computer that the next generation of the internet uses as its backbone. Unfortunately, this cannot currently be a reality due to the slow amount of transactions per second, or TPS, that Ethereum can handle. On average, the blockchain can handle 20 TPS, which is significantly less than the amount needed if the entire world one day wanted to use Ethereum. Ideally, the fees for sending transactions on the network would be pennies, but due to the high congestion due to the thousands of dApps, tokens, and DeFi protocols built on the platform, fees have been incredibly high lately. In some cases, it can cost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to interact with a smart contract. These costs are unacceptable for a platform that wants to be usable by everyone.Fortunately, Ethereum 2.0 plans to mitigate these problems by introducing sharding, an innovation that will allow the network to scale to over 100,000 TPS. However, this will not be available until 2022 at the earliest, so a solution is needed as soon as possible to ensure that other smart contract platforms, such as Binance Chain and Cardano, don\u2019t overtake Ethereum\u2019s spot as the main smart contract platform.Polygon, formerly Matic Network, is one of the largest projects with a mainnet release that is helping to scale Ethereum. When they released in 2019 as a Binance Launchpad offering, they implemented the Plasma scaling solution, which was co-authored by Vitalik Buterin, creator of Ethereum. Plasma was designed to make transactions less data-intensive on the main Ethereum chain, leading to reduced costs. Now, Polygon not only offers Plasma, but also completely unique blockchains that can be interoperable with other Polygon chains and Ethereum itself. This offers greater flexibility and security for projects that are looking to be a part of the Ethereum ecosystem, but do not want to have to rely on Ethereum for security or transaction processing. This new feature makes them not only a viable option for scaling Ethereum, but also being an \u201cinternet of blockchains\u201d like Polkadot or Cosmos.The main Polygon chain is proof of stake, and holders of the MATIC token help to secure the network. The MATIC token has seen impressive gains over the past year, but is a speculative hold: if something happens to Polygon, or they become an irrelevant scaling solution, the token will plummet in price, along with the security of the network.The Polygon mainnet has been live since May 2020, and as a result they have already experienced adoption from many dApps interested in scaling. Some of the biggest include the DeFi protocol Aave, NFT platform Aavegotchi, and casino Decentral Games. They can handle nearly 65,000 TPS, over thirty times more than Visa, which handles 2,000 TPS, and they boast that the transaction cost is 1\/100th of Ethereum\u2019s.Another project making headlines recently is Optimistic Ethereum, created by the company Optimism. Instead of using a different blockchain like Polygon, they are creating an application \u201cinside of Ethereum that executes transactions more efficiently than Ethereum itself.\u201d It uses Optimistic Rollup technology, which essentially \u201crolls up\u201d transactions into single blocks, then publishes those blocks to the Ethereum mainnet. By taking hundreds of transactions and bundling them together, users save on fees and time, as Optimism estimates that transaction speeds will be 200 TPS or higher. It also has native smart contract functionality, so anyone who has an Ethereum smart contract can easily port it to Optimism. In fact, Uniswap already built a demo showing the capability of Optimistic Rollups, called Unipig. It was capable of handling 250 TPS and had extremely low fees. There is no Optimism coin, and the security of Optimistic Rollups is guaranteed for as long as Ethereum itself is secure. Even though Optimism is not releasing their application until July 2021, there is already a lot of hype around the project, and they have many partners jumping onboard, including Uniswap, Synthetix, and potentially Coinbase. The main drawback of the Optimistic Rollup application is that there is a week-long waiting period in between the time that users withdraw their funds and are able to use them on the Ethereum mainnet. This is done to ensure that there are not any malicious transactions, and if there are, they will be stopped before they are sent to the blockchain. Both projects have made incredible innovations in helping to scale Ethereum and making it usable by the masses. However, there is one major disadvantage to having two different scaling solutions: they are not interoperable. If someone wanted to use Optimism to complete a cheap Uniswap transaction, then deposit those tokens into Matic\u2019s Aave smart contract, this would not be possible without interaction with the mainnet, which may be expensive and time-consuming. The competition between multiple scaling projects may encourage them to innovate, but unless they both are capable of supporting the same dApps, users will have to deal with the hassle of switching around from solution to solution.Regardless of which solution becomes the main platform for scaling, the real winner of the battle between scaling solutions will be the users and developers who have the ability to use Ethereum as intended, and help make Ethereum achieve its goal of being the future of the internet.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3292616","Time":1617885936,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.032,"neu":0.774,"pos":0.194,"compound":0.9995,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.574,"pos_right":0.426,"compound_right":0.6369,"Total Score":0.94511},"68":{"Title":"PureStake Closes $6M Strategic Round of Funding led by CoinFund, with participation from IOSG Ventures","Content":"PureStake, the company developing the Moonbeam smart contract platform, announced the completion of a $6 million strategic round led by CoinFund, a leading blockchain-focused investment firm. The round included participation from Binance Labs, ParaFi, Coinbase Ventures, Fenbushi Capital, IOSG Ventures, as well as previous seed investors. This round of funding will be used to hire development resources, build additional integrations and developer tools, perform third-party security audits, and establish a market presence in Asia. These activities will position the team for a successful launch of the Moonbeam network in 2021.Moonbeam has quickly grown to become one of the most prominent parachains in the Polkadot ecosystem. In the six months since closing a seed round and launching a TestNet in September 2020, dozens of projects have begun building on \u2014 and integrating with \u2014 the Moonbeam network. Examples of protocols with planned or live integrations on Moonbeam include SushiSwap, Balancer, IDEX, Seascape, Linear Finance, and Ocean Protocol.The PureStake team plans to launch the Moonbeam network in a multi-phased approach similar to the one previously employed for the Polkadot network launch: a TestNet parachain deployment (currently live), the Moonriver network deployment to Kusama, followed by a Moonbeam network deployment for Polkadot (planned for later this year). This funding round will help the team plan and successfully launch each deployment, including third-party security audits of the code, as soon as the functionality is available.The funding round also included a broad set of prominent venture capital firms across the blockchain industry including Hypersphere Ventures, Hashkey, Arrington XRP, A195, KR1, D1 Ventures, Mechanism Capital, Divergence Ventures, and Signum Capital.The Moonbeam and Moonriver parachains are expected to launch later this year, once parachain functionality has been enabled on Polkadot and Kusama, respectively.About the Moonbeam NetworkMoonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform on the Polkadot network that makes it easy to build natively interoperable applications. This Ethereum compatibility allows developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and DApp frontends to Moonbeam with minimal changes. As a parachain on the Polkadot network, Moonbeam will benefit from the shared security of the Polkadot relay chain and integrations with other chains that are connected to Polkadot. Currently in active development by PureStake, Moonbeam is expected to reach MainNet by mid-2021.

The article can be found hereSoftware engineer Jonty Wareing has made a startling discovery about the non-fungible tokens that have been making headlines recently: these NFTs are more centralized than we once thought. The solution to this problem is to reissue NFTs as fast as possible, before they become forgotten and worthless. Since the beginning of 2021, NFTs have been blowing up, both in terms of mainstream media coverage and price action. They have achieved over half a billion dollars of trading volume in the past month, and some have been selling for prices in the millions of dollars. As a result, many companies have popped up and have allowed users to create their own NFTs, such as Cent, Nifty, and Makerspace. These companies allow users to upload their own pictures, attach it to an NFT, then sell it. Though this sounds elegant and like a great way for people to join the NFT movement, it has a couple flaws.As pointed out by Wareing, these NFTs are dangerously centralized, and their life is directly tied to the existence of the company that minted it. Instead of the pictures being stored in a decentralized manner, they are instead stored on the website\u2019s storage, meaning that if the website or company shuts down, the NFT image will be gone forever. This has already started to happen. For example, TronDogs, the Crypto Kitties clone based on the Tron blockchain, shut down, and as a result all of their users permanently lost their assets.The website checkmynft.com allows users to see if their NFT is stored directly on the blockchain or if it is stored in a Google Drive or Amazon account, which means it is destined to be deleted at some point.Fortunately, all of these NFTs are not destined for failure. The websites that have been using insecure data storage methods can fix their problems before it is too late. For example, they can store the pictures and data directly onto the Ethereum blockchain, or by using a storage blockchain such as Arweave. Even though Wareing is correct, and the already-issued NFT assets cannot be changed, the new and more robust NFTs could be sent to the owners of the current NFTs, which would solve the problem for the future. And, to prevent there being two NFTs, one that is future-proof and one that could break, the companies could break the old ones as soon as possible by deleting the image from their servers. This would be incredibly expensive, and cause some controversy over the \u201coriginality\u201d of NFT assets, but would ensure that the NFTs, some of which are worth millions of dollars, would not disappear overnight.With the speed at which NFTs have gained popularity, it was inevitable that some companies would take advantage of the boon and use shortcuts to deliver a cheap product to their customers. Fortunately, this problem has been caught before it is too late, and NFTs still have the chance to achieve their goal of being a decentralized and permanently-available asset.

Though a lot of this trading is done for the purpose of speculation and with a profit motive instead of due to true belief in the space and its collectible items, it signifies the legitimization of this asset class and foreshadows a bright future for blockchain technology. Non-Fungible Tokens, or NFTs, are unique assets that are minted and stored on the blockchain. They can be thought of as trading cards, where there is only a certain amount available, and users can buy and sell them to one another through marketplaces. They are non-fungible because every single NFT is unique, as opposed to something like cash, where every dollar is equal and interchangable.The first major NFT platform that arose was CryptoKitties, which came out in December 2017, and allowed users to buy and sell digital artworks of kittens. Today, it is a relatively small percentage of NFT trading volume, and it has been taken over by other projects.Today, the largest NFT project with over $281 million in trading volume over the past 30 days is NBA Top Shot. This is a platform, built on the Flow blockchain, that allows users to buy and sell NBA \u201cmoments.\u201d These moments consist of videos of NBA stars having some sort of highlight moment, such as making a dunk. They can be thought of like trading cards that have pictures instead of videos. The platform has exploded to over 300,000 users since its release in late 2020.The largest Ethereum-based NFT, which is the second overall, is CryptoPunks, which allows users to trade pictures of over 10,000 unique collectible characters. They are responsible for $108 million in volume in the past month.To the average person, these pictures and videos may seem interesting, but definitely not worth the tens of thousands of dollars that people are asking for them. And, to an extent, they are right, as a lot of the current NFT trading is based on pure speculation. Instead of buying an NBA moment as a collectible item, many users are buying them in hopes that their valuation will increase, similar to how people have bought other assets, like sneakers or Beanie Babies, in hopes that their value will increase.The best example of this can be seen in an NFT artwork sold at auction for over $69 million, making its artist, Beeple, the third-richest living artist in the world. This title should belong to a household name, but instead goes to Beeple because he was the first to take advantage of this space. After he sold his work, he admitted that the NFT space appears to be a bubble, and investing in NFT artwork is incredibly risky due to many eventually becoming worthless.When everyone is buying collectibles for the intention of selling them instead of keeping them as a novelty, they are bound to be overvalued and highly speculative, which is what some think that we are seeing in the NFT space.However, others argue that these NFTs are the next wave of art, and users can have the chance to own the next Picasso by buying a CryptoPunk or NBA moment. These NFTs represent something that has never been done before, true digital ownership of a piece of art, and as such have significant value. Fortunately for the long-term future of NFTs, they are good for more than just artwork. There are many real-world use cases for NFTs, and they can be revolutionary to traditional industries. For example, MetisDAO is using NFTs as a \u201cpassport\u201d to keep track of a user\u2019s reputation and collaboration history within their ecosystem. Furthermore, Enjin Coin is building a platform that will allow users to have video game items as NFTs. This means that a user could have a sword in a game like Minecraft, and transfer it into another video game like Fortnite, which has never been done before. One of the use cases with the most potential is the storing of official documents, such as housing titles, birth certificates, and identification. This would allow anyone to virtually hold their most important documents and have all the benefits of a blockchain, such as privacy and verifiable legitimacy.Even though a digital picture may not always carry a valuation in the millions of dollars, or have half a billion in trading volume, this current boom in NFTs represents a significant victory for blockchain technology. It has brought user adoption and awareness of these platforms, and will lead to more users being comfortable using blockchain wallets like MetaMask, and sending transactions to smart contracts. The future use cases of NFTs will continue to develop the space and legitimize the industry beyond speculative trading of digital artwork, and help bring about the future of the internet. And who knows, maybe these NFTs will be the Picassos, Da Vincis, and Michaelangelos of the future.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3243078","Time":1616585399,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.009,"neu":0.869,"pos":0.122,"compound":0.9981,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.49905},"72":{"Title":"Bitpush Exclusive Interview: How MetisDAO Plans to Fully Realize the Potential of DAOs","Content":"MetisDAO is a decentralized layer 2 protocol that allows anyone to create their own decentralized company, or DAC. Bitpush sat down with Kevin Liu, Co-Founder and Product Lead, to find out how they are creating a simple, fast, and cheap protocol to help all internet apps migrate from Web2 to Web3, and bring about the internet of the future.Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, or DAOs, are transparent organizations based on code and programming and are governed democratically by members of the organization, unlike traditional companies which are governed by a board of executives. An example of a DAO would be Compound.finance, whose members hold the COMP token and have the privilege of voting on upgrades and rules to change the protocol. Though this seems like a revolutionary concept, it is barely scratching the surface of what a DAO can do.\u201cFor Metis, we are building what we call a \u2018Whole New World\u2019 on the blockchain because we believe everyone, every business, every project or community can construct their decentralized Company, DAC, on the blockchain so they can do collaborations, do business, and build up connections with each other.\u201cMost of today\u2019s DAOs are only capable of voting and governance features. MetisDAO was created in order to fully exploit the potential of the DAO, and allow community members to have much greater influence over their operations, instead of simply voting for features and waiting for them to be implemented. MetisDAO wants to remove boundaries and create an individual-centric system.This type of governance structure is groundbreaking, and could lead to innovative and complex dApps such as a decentralized Reddit, new DeFi protocols, a decentralized crowdfunding platform, and many more.Though it sounds like these decentralized applications would be difficult to create, MetisDAO already has templates users can take advantage of to create a task collaboration dApp, like a decentralized Trello, and it can be done in three simple steps.First, a user chooses the name and description of the project they would like to create. Then the user stakes a certain amount of Metis, the token that fuels the entire ecosystem, in order to activate the project. Now, using templates provided by Metis or by using the development features they offer, the project can be created and launched, and can fully utilize all of the features built in to the Metis protocol. Unlike a typical company, where employees are required to bend to the company\u2019s will, MetisDAO has created an individual-centric system. What this means is that somebody can join a DAO, complete one task, receive payment, and then leave. This system vastly expands upon the gig economy created by the likes of Uber and Airbnb, and makes it possible for anyone to work to their fullest potential.One of the problems in the anonymous blockchain system is making users trust one another. Fortunately, MetisDAO also solves this problem with a reputation and staking system. Whenever a user joins a DAO, they are required to stake a certain amount of Metis tokens. This collateral acts as a bond to ensure that anyone who joins is economically incentivized to carry out their task. So if we put a task on our task board DAO and offer money for its completion, and someone named Bob accepts the task, he has to put up a certain amount of collateral before the agreement is settled. If he completes the task as agreed, Bob will get his collateral back, plus the amount agreed upon for finishing the job. If he doesn\u2019t finish the task, he will lose his collateral. Furthermore, every user has a reputation-based NFT attached to their account, which helps users accumulate Reputation Power. This acts as a \u201cpassport\u201d to all of the different DAOs, and holds all information about prior collaborations. So if Bob doesn\u2019t follow through with an agreement, his NFT will be permanently blemished, so future users will know to proceed with caution when dealing with him. On the other hand, if he successfully collaborates with a DAO, this performance will be marked on his NFT, and future users will know that Bob is a trustworthy worker. This allows complete strangers to have a high level of trust with one another, and rest assured that bad actors will not be incentivized to use the network.MetisDAO is also a Layer 2 protocol based on Optimistic Rollup, which means that transaction fees are low and transaction times are incredibly fast. Also, it provides high scalability potential and rich functionalities to support various decentralized applications, businesses, and communities in running on the blockchain.\u201cWith Metis\u2019 Layer2 framework and innovative DAO structure, blockchain can really support real business running on top of it. Metis hopes to expand Ethereum from just transactions, like DeFi or payments, to support real value creation activities and collaboration.\u201d MetisDAO is preparing for a testnet release in a few weeks, which will allow users to test out the platform and launch their own DAOs. They expect their mainnet launch, along with the public offering of their Metis token, to take place in Q2 2021.

It plans to implement EIP 1559 in July 2021, which will help stabilize transaction fee prices, and also potentially make Ethereum a fixed-supply coin, instead of one with infinite inflation.EIP 1559 is an improvement to Ethereum that helps to stabilize fees by moving to a base fee model and reduce the network's inflation. Right now, Ethereum fees are not only incredibly high, but also very volatile. One day, you may expect to pay $50 for Uniswap fees, then $100 the next day, or even the next hour. This has made Ethereum effectively unusable as a smart contract platform for everyone but the largest yield farmers and those who transaction millions of Ethereum daily. As a result, other smart contract platforms have been getting more attention, both in terms of network volume and token price appreciation. For example, Binance Coin and Cardano are both up 800% on the year, and Dapper Labs, the creator of Crypto Kitties, has seen their Flow smart contract and NFT platform rise 3300% since January. All of these platforms are technically superior to Etheruem, and in theory should be higher in market cap, however the first-mover advantage of Ethereum has kept it in first for now. If they don\u2019t solve their scaling problem soon, this situation could quickly change. Fortunately, the team behind Ethereum has voted to implement EIP 1559, which will solve many of the fundamental problems of the platform.Right now, Ethereum\u2019s fees are based on an auction-style system. Whenever someone sends a transaction, their fee goes directly to the miners. Thus, if a user sends a higher fee, it incentivizes the miner to include their transaction in the next Etheruem block. This leads to a problem where users who can pay a high price can clog the network, and users who want to send cheap transactions are stuck either waiting hours, if not days, for their transaction to be included in a block.EIP 1559 changes the fee market to fix this auction-based issue. Now, there will be a minimum fee for every transaction which will be burned and taken out of the total supply, instead of being sent to the miners. If the network gets more congested, the fee will be raised for everyone accordingly. Furthermore, if users really want their transactions to be prioritized, they can include a \u201ctip\u201d to the miners on top of the base fee, so they are incentivized to include the transaction in the next block, and they keep the tip as a reward.This will not help significantly with the transaction fees, since the network will still be congested, but it will help with the volatility. Instead of users having to research the optimal ETH gas fee whenever they want to send a transaction, they can instead simply send it, without any worry that it will not go through. This fee burning mechanism will also have an impact on the long-term supply of Ethereum. As of now, Ethereum has no supply cap. This means that over time, Ethereum\u2019s total supply will increase infinitely, which has led some to be skeptical about the long-term value proposition of an asset that has no capped supply. With the new fee-burning mechanism, a set amount of Ethereum will be burned each block. This will significantly reduce the inflation of Ethereum per year. It is even possible that Ethereum will become a deflationary asset, if the fees burned are greater than the rewards given to miners per block. According to the basic laws of supply and demand, a lower supply with the same demand means a higher price, which could help Ethereum continue to increase in price as the bull market dies down. One group who is not a fan of these Ethereum changes are the Ethereum miners who help secure the network. They will see a significant decrease in their revenue, and may leave the Ethereum network and use their mining power to secure other blockchains that offer a higher revenue. As a result, the security of the Ethereum network may decrease. Though this is a genuine concern, it will likely not matter much, as Ethereum will be transitioning to proof of stake within the next couple of years, and all the miners who believe in the future of Ethereum will continue mining.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3207903","Time":1615380416,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.063,"neu":0.812,"pos":0.125,"compound":0.9938,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.657,"pos_right":0.343,"compound_right":0.5719,"Total Score":0.930515},"74":{"Title":"< Bitpush Exclusive > Multicoin Capital: The Investment Signifies Binance's Trust in Multicoin Capital as Fund Managers","Content":"Binance becomes a limited partner in Multicoin Capital Crypto Fund, which is the first time the crypto exchange has made an outside fund investment.In an extensive interview with Bitpush,  Multicoin Capital spokesperson John Robert Reed revealed that their talks with Binance in regard to investment started late last year.

The original piece can be read here.One of the biggest problems Bitcoin faces on its path to mainstream worldwide adoption, and what\u2019s argued by Joe Kelly, is the fact it could be theoretically banned and dominated by powerful world governments. However, this argument is flawed for multiple reasons, and as a resilient cryptocurrency, Bitcoin truly is \u201cunstoppable code.\u201d Let\u2019s start with a summary of Kelly\u2019s argument. He concedes that Bitcoin is unstoppable code, and that you cannot stop Bitcoin by attempting to shut down nodes or hack the protocol. Instead, the way to kill Bitcoin is by using two crucial parts of its infrastructure: The physical proof-of-work consensus mechanism, and the monetary incentive to uphold the network.Kelly\u2019s theoretical argument starts with the banning of any Bitcoin-related activity by major world governments, including the United States and China. They ban it on the grounds that it is a net-negative for society, and undermines the power of their currencies.The second part has to do with the hashing power of the Bitcoin network, which costs around $3.3 billion per year, as of July 2020. For the sake of his argument, we will say that this number is the same today, even though it is slightly different. After the hyptothetical ban on cryptocurrencies, the United States and other major countries would begin seizing major mining operations and running them under state control. Furthermore, the world governments would use their massive defense budgets to contract Lockheed Martin, a defense company, to create their own mining operation that will dominate Bitcoin hashing power. At this point, the major world governments have complete control over the network, and refuse to allow any transactions go through, meaning Bitcoin is completely worthless.Though there is some validity in the argument, there are some flaws in the reasoning that result in an unrealistic conclusion. For the sake of keeping the situation valid, we will assume that the United States decides to fully ban Bitcoin. However, the idea that all world governments would agree is arguably unrealistic. Many large countries, including China and Russia, would benefit from a rise of Bitcoin and the United States dollar losing its place as the world reserve country. This could lead to an international stalemate wherein the United States and China are allocating resources to increasing the hash power of the network and supporting different mining groups, which would actually make the Bitcoin network more secure.However, to further give the advantage to Kelly\u2019s argument, we will assume that the world governments band together and decide to ban any sort of action with Bitcoin, be it mining, exchanging, or otherwise. In this situation, Bitcoin would definitely not have, nor deserve, a $1 trillion market cap. However, like many illicit items, there would still be a black market for the good, and transactions would take place. In order to circumvent the seizure of mining farms and stoppage of the network, a hard fork could take place. This would change the network\u2019s consensus mechanism from proof of work, which requires physical computers securing the network, to proof of stake, whereby users use their coins as collateral in order to secure the network. In this scenario, this means that no matter how much computing power the world governments are able to amass, they cannot bring down the network. Instead, holders of Bitcoin can secure the network in an anonymous fashion from the safety of their homes and hidden behind layers of VPNs and other privacy tools.For the world governments to take over a proof of stake blockchain, they would need to amass 51% of the staked Bitcoins. Though this sounds simple, it would be incredibly difficult. First, with all exchanges banned, there would be no way for them to buy Bitcoins. Even if there was a method for them to buy Bitcoins, they would be driving up the price significantly. As the governments reached the 40-50% mark, the price of Bitcoins would be incredibly high, as each individual Bitcoin could be cruicial in ensuring that the governement gains control of the network. This could lead the price to be millions, if not billions, of dollars, and make it incredibly hard for governments to amass the amount needed. The other option would be to sieze coins from users. If they wanted to do this instead, they would have to prove that someone had access to a Bitcoin wallet, which would be as difficult as finding a needle in a haystack, if the haystack was the world population and the needle was a flash drive. This method would prove to be unsustainable and impossible to pull off for any extended period of time.Whether world governments like it or not, Bitcoin and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies are here to stay. Though Kelly\u2019s argument has validity in the fact that banning Bitcoin would significantly hurt its value proposition, it would not be hurt to the point that it would be useless, or that the incentive to secure the network would be destroyed. The decentralized, secure, and ever-adapting nature of the blockchain and decentralized consensus means that Bitcoin is capable of weathering any storm that may come its way.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3181227","Time":1614110934,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.096,"neu":0.816,"pos":0.088,"compound":-0.9455,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.527,"pos_right":0.473,"compound_right":0.5559,"Total Score":-0.72029},"76":{"Title":"What is Binance Coin and Why is it Up 800% Since January","Content":"As Cryptocurrencies and DeFi continues to boom, the main DeFi platform, Ethereum, has seen tremendous increases in fees, making the network almost unusable. In response, users have begun moving to rival platforms, such as the Binance Smart Chain, which offers high fees and low transactions, and is challenging Ethereum\u2019s position as the DeFi king.Binance Coin, BNB, was created in 2017 by the centralized exchange Binance. Initially, they held an ICO for the ERC20 token. At release, its main use was to decrease fees on Binance by 25%, but the utility of the token quickly grew.Each quarter, Binance, the world\u2019s largest exchange, dedicates 20% of their profits to buying back and burning the BNB token. In economic terms, this means that the token has the same demand with a lower supply, so it leads to an increase in the price of the token, and directly correlates the success of Binance as an exchange to the success of the Binance Coin. This program will continue until 50% of the total supply is burned.Furthermore, the Binance token is used for Binance\u2019s IEOs, or Initial Exchange Offerings. These events are similar to ICOs, where a new token is offered to the public for the first time, but instead of being available to everyone, the tokens are available only on the Binance exchange, and users can buy these new tokens only using BNB. Some notable tokens which have had Binance IEOs include Band Protocol, Kava, and Matic Network. For the BNB token, this has a similar effect to what Ethereum experienced during the ICO craze of 2017: Users buy as much BNB as possible in order to buy these tokens, thus indirectly driving up the price of BNB.In April 2019, Binance released their decentralized exchange on Binance Chain, a blockchain based around the BNB token, and migrated from their ERC20 token to their native blockchain. This exchange allows for users to trade a plethora of assets, such as ETH, BTC, and many other cryptocurrencies, in a decentralized and regulation-free manner. On this blockchain, the BNB token pays a similar role as ETH does on the Ethereum blockchain: The means for paying transaction fees and as the \u201canchor\u201d asset of the network.Without a doubt, the most significant driver of the BNB price was the release of the Binance Smart Chain in September 2020. This blockchain allows for the creation of smart contracts and dApps, making the token a competitor to Ethereum. It is built on top of the Tendermint and Cosmos SDK. This means that, like Cosmos, the Binance Smart Chain supports fast and cheap transactions, as well as offering staking rewards for the BNB token.One of the biggest problems for blockchains wanting to compete with Ethereum is that Etheruem has a massive first-mover advantage, and already has the majority of DeFi projects building on its platform. To combat this problem, the Binance Smart Chain has made itself Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible, meaning that Ethereum dApps can easily transfer their projects to this blockchain.Binance is also leveraging their numerous partnerships within the cryptocurrency sector to advance their blockchain, and have announced collaborations with the likes of Chainlink, Band Protocol, Aave, and Ontology. They also have created an accelerator program to incentivize new projects to build in their ecosystem.As one could imagine, with the ever-increasing Ethereum fees bloating the network, Binance Smart Chain and BNB appear to be an enticing alternative. This narrative has been furthered by the fact that PancakeSwap, Binance Smart Chain\u2019s Uniswap competitor, reached a billion-dollar market cap on February 18th, and surpassed Uniswap\u2019s daily volume on February 19th. Both of these events have sent the BNB price booming, and Binance Coin is now the third largest cryptocurrency by market cap.Even though it appears like Ethereum\u2019s days are numbered, the smart contract king still has a chance to keep its throne. Some controversy surrounding the Binance blockchain has to do with its centralization. There are only 21 validators on the network responsible for securing and validating transactions, compared to over ten thousand on Ethereum. With 21 entities controlling the fate of a $40 billion dollar blockchain ecosystem, there is some concern that an unforeseen event could occur that may result in double-spending or some other problem due to the lack of decentralization. Additionally, the BNB token has not yet been declared \u201cnot a security\u201d by regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission, meaning that there is a chance that the token could be declared an unregistered security, like what happened with XRP earlier this year. Ethereum, on the other hand, has been declared decentralized enough to not be a security, according to the SEC. For the time being, Ethereum continues to be the smart contract king, even if the network is barely usable in its current state. But, if Ethereum\u2019s Layer 2 Scaling solutions help to alleviate the congestion on the network, it just may be able to keep its place at the top. On the other hand, the Binance Smart Chain is proving to be a viable competitor, and it has a legitimate chance of challenging Ethereum\u2019s dominance, as it has already shown over the past couple of weeks. Nevertheless, in the rapidly-developing world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, nothing is certain, and the true smart contract king may have yet to be created.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3166042","Time":1613845076,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.032,"neu":0.811,"pos":0.158,"compound":0.999,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.4995},"77":{"Title":"Do Polkadot or Cardano Stand a Chance to Overtake Ethereum","Content":"Right now, Ethereum is the king of smart contract platforms, with a market capitalization of over $200 billion. Cardano and Polkadot are second and third, with market capitalizations of $26 and $25 billion, respectively. These smart contract platforms, albeit significantly smaller in adoption, offer features far surpassing those of Ethereum, but this may not be enough to account for Ethereum\u2019s first-mover advantage. In 2014, Ethereum was released, and promised to be a next-generation blockchain capable of hosting decentralized applications. It was an instant hit, and since then has been the main smart contract platform, hosting nearly all of the ICOs of 2017 and having the vast majority of DeFi applications in 2020, like Yearn Finance, Aave, and Compound. When it was initially released, three of the eight co-founders were Vitalik Buterin, Charles Hoskinson, and Gavin Wood. Very early into the project\u2019s release, Hoskinson was asked to leave the project. In response, he founded IOHK, and has released a rival smart contract platform Cardano, which he hopes will be an Ethereum killer. Gavin Wood also left and founded the Web3 Foundation to advance blockchain. They created Polkadot in 2016, a smart contract platform whose goal is to connect many blockchains, including Ethereum, together, and created a decentralized and open-source internet. In the recent 2021 bull run, all three projects have seen massive price increases. Let\u2019s look at some of the technology and adoption behind Ethereum, Cardano, and Polkadot to see if these competitors are capable of rivaling Ethereum.Ethereum is the oldest of the three platforms, and thus is the least impressive in terms of technology. It was hailed as a blockchain 2.0 platform at release, but since then much greater improvements have been made in blockchain, and many projects today are claiming to be blockchain 3.0. As of now, Ethereum is a proof of work blockchain, and handles around 15 transactions per second, with transaction costs being around $1.50 at the time of writing. To code smart contracts on Ethereum, developers need to use Solidity, a new coding language created by Gavin Wood specifically for Ethereum. This seems like a large barrier to entry, but the language is similar to JavaScript, which is incredibly popular, and seasoned computer scientists and software engineers have not and will not have a problem adapting to the new language. Ethereum cannot only be looked at in its current state, as improvements are being made daily, and Ethereum 2.0 is being developed. When it is released, Ethereum will be a proof of stake blockchain instead of proof of work, and will be capable of handling nearly 100,000 transactions per second, and at a fraction of the cost of today\u2019s transactions. This will be a huge upgrade for Ethereum, possibly the biggest since its initial release. Even though Polkadot\u2019s mainnet was not released until 2020, their whitepaper came out in 2016, which makes it older than Cardano by one year. Due to the incredibly long development time, Polkadot has been able to refine its platform and offer incredibly enticing features for developers and users alike, such as interoperability, which allows different blockchains to coexist and share information and data. This means that Bitcoin could be coming to DeFi soon through the use of Polkadot. They also use a proof of stake consensus mechanism, and claim to be capable of 80,000 transactions per second, with relatively cheap transaction costs. Instead of using Solidity, Polkadot utilizes Rust and JavaScript, two popular coding languages, making it easier to develop with than Ethereum. Cardano\u2019s whitepaper was released in 2017, and a blockchain was created quickly after, but it was basic in functionality. Unlike Polkadot, they decided to release a blockchain first, then update and develop it, instead of waiting for everything to be ready. As of January 2021, Cardano still does not have smart contract functionality, but this is slated to be released in the next update, Goguen, some time in early 2021. These smart contracts will be coded in Plutus, which is supposed to be more secure and simpler than Solidity or JavaScript. One of the reasons that Cardano has taken a long time to release its updates is due to their dedication to peer-reviews and ensuring that their technology is sound before releasing it to the public. The proof of stake blockchain currently can do 200 transactions per second for a low fee around 0.2 ADA. However, they plan to upgrade scaling after they add smart contract functionality, which will bring the blockchain to a theoretical one million transactions per second, and add more interoperability features, though the release date of this update is entirely unknown. On paper, Cardano or Polkadot appear far superior to Ethereum, due to their newer technology and architecture. However, arguably more important than the technology is the adoption, partnerships, and real-world use-cases of a blockchain platform, and Ethereum has plenty. Of the top 100 tokens, only a handful are not found on Ethereum, and the platform has $35 billion locked into DeFi, significantly more than all other platforms combined. Furthermore, many of the world\u2019s largest companies are using Ethereum in some form, including Microsoft, Intel, and JPMorgan. It also has the greatest retail exposure, as it is traded nearly everywhere Bitcoin is traded. It also has the benefit of officially being declared sufficiently decentralized to not be a security by the SEC, which means that Ethereum will not face a Ripple-esque lawsuit. Here is a list of the members of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a group focused on helping corporations use Ethereum in their businesses:Polkadot, being the 6th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has some dApps being built on the network, but not anywhere near Ethereum\u2019s number. There are approximately 253 projects building on Polkadot, but over 3,000 on Ethereum. Polkadot does not have any significant partnerships with companies, but all of this can be explained by the fact that their mainnet has been live for less than a year. If momentum builds on the network, the number of projects could grow exponentially. Additionally, the fact that Polkadot's goal is to connect different blockchains means that the success of other blockchains could relate to success for Polkadot. For example, if Ethereum is connected to Binance Chain through Polkadot's interoperability feature, then the success of both of those blockchains could be beneficial for Polkadot. Cardano is in a similar situation, and they have projects planning to build on their platform once smart contracts are released, but nothing yet. However, they do have some significant partnerships, including IBM, New Balance, the Georgian Government, and the Ethopian government. This could be significant for the platform in the future, and offer them a chance to be seen as a legitimate solution by other governments.Do Cardano and Polkadot stand a chance to take down the king of smart contract platforms? In cryptocurrency, anything can happen. There could be numerous issues with Ethereum in the coming years, such as an Ethereum 2.0 delay, some exploit or hack, or another unprecedented event that causes users to switch to another platform. However, catching Ethereum will be difficult, as it has the clear first-mover advantage. With the amount of dApps and value locked into DeFi, users will need to have a clear incentive to move platforms. Furthermore, the real-world partnerships that Ethereum has developed will not disappear overnight, and the other two projects need to work to catch up. Nonetheless, the lower fees, higher staking, and future interoperability that Polkadot and Cardano offer may be enough to attract users and their money.Cryptocurrencies, especially smart contract platforms, are still incredibly new, and trying to guess which platform will be dominant in ten years is nearly impossible. Maybe it will be a platform that has not been created yet, or one supported by a powerful government. One thing is certain: the competition between these three protocols will drive them to innovate further, and the winner in the end will be the users of these platforms.

CME added Bitcoin futures in December 2017. Now, Ethereum futures are open for trading.Tim McCourt, Managing Director at CME Group, talks with Bitpush News on the reasons behind CME\u2019s decision to launch Ethereum Futures.The transcript for the interview can be found below: Bitpush: The first question. What is the reason behind CME\u2019s decision to launch Ethereum Futures?Tim McCourt: That's a great question. When we look at our product development at CME group, it really is largely informed by customer demand, and we got into the cryptocurrency derivative space back in 2017. Over the last 3 years, customers have just been consistently demanding and asking for CME to introduce futures on the Ether-Dollar reference rate which we launched in May of 2018, which is the underlying index, because our future\u2019s contracts is financially settled. It settles in USD. And I would say, when you then look at the kind of increase in excitement and interest in the ETH network, and then therefore, Ether, that's also increased over the last year, so a number of DeFi projects come online. Also, it finally made very good sense for us to offer the futures to enable our current customers and other market participants. Not only the ability to hedge other Ether positions they may have, but also to use it as a way to access the Ether market as well. In terms of the fund, the exposure the contract provides.Bitpush: Is the reason similar to launch Bitcoin futures 3 years ago?Tim McCourt: It's similar to an extent where I would say a good number of customers want to use the future\u2019s contract, trading at a regulated futures exchange as a primary access vehicle for the cryptocurrency. And we heard that for Bitcoin, we heard that for Ether.The one thing I will say is different is back in 2015 and 2016 when we were leading up to the Bitcoin futures, given bitcoins relative prominence as the largest token. Bitcoin was a proxy for getting involved in cryptocurrency. In general, people wanted to get involved in this new exciting thing.I'll see what's a little bit different with Ether is there's very specific interests and demand in the ETH network and Ether, as a token, which is a little bit different, because it's more specific in terms of people wanting to be involved in some of the network of impacts of the specialized finance projects.Bitpush: Yeah, it is true because Bitcoin it's more like the store of the value, but ETH is a really a financial infrastructure. When did CME decide to launch ETH future? I know the news coming out in last December. But in the internal discussion, when did you first consider to launch the ETH futures?Tim McCourt: So I would say we probably arrived at the decision a little bit prior to the public announcement, but it's something that we've been validating customers for several months before that. We go through regimented internal decision process where we want to validate the concept in the product design with trading participants, with our clearing members, with our regulator. So there are lots of things that we go through. It's probably a several months long process even before the public announcement. The final decision to launch the contract was a few weeks or a few days before the public announcement, but it's a multi month process.Bitpush: That sounds cool. For CME, how do you think the crypto market environment is different from three years ago? I know like three years ago when CME first lauched Bitcoin future, it opened a new chapter for cryptocurrency market. Tim McCourt: I think probably the biggest change, I would say 2021 versus 2017 or 2018 is the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency trading. That's certainly a story that we can't ignore. And we've seen it happening for a few years. But it's really accelerated the last few months. I think most notably, when we look at the bitcoin futures that trade in Q4 2020, we had a record average daily open interest of about 11,000 bitcoin futures which represents a little over 55,000 bitcoin.That was kind of a record force, and that was up over 230 % versus Q4 2019. We also in December had a record number of large open interest holders which are those traders that hold a open position of 25 Bitcoin futures or more, which  means 125 or more equivalent bitcoin, because the multiplier is 5 Bitcoin. You then look in January of this year, just last month, it was our record month in terms of average daily volume where we traded over 17,500 contracts per day so, almost 88,000 billion per day, which was up over 60 % versus January of 2020. These are some data points that the and a couple of that with what we're hearing publicly as companies disclosed their either investing in bitcoin or accepting bitcoin or cryptocurrency as payments. There's really this institutional adoption that is accelerating. The way I would summarize is I feel like the conversations we were having around 2017, the launch of Bitcoin Future, was customers were asking us what is Bitcoin? What is cryptocurrency? Now, with the launch of Ether Future, 3 years later, the questions are more around. How much should I be allocating? How should I be trading cryptocurrency? So the questions themselves have also evolved as more and more people have become familiar with cryptocurrency and figure out what it means for their operations and their firms.Bitpush: That's wonderful. So do you think the institutional adoption is also one of the reason for CME  to decide to launch the Ether futures in last December? Will it be one of the factors?Tim McCourt: Yes, certainly the success of bitcoin which we think has been very successful also encouraged us to expand into a second digital asset. We also launched bitcoin options just about a year ago in January 2020. So I would say yes, the bitcoin\u2019 success certainly gave us more confidence in expanding our cryptocurrency offering. It really was driven by customer demand. And that demand is coming from both current bitcoin future traders, and market participants, as well as some people who are more exclusively focused on ether that also want to see a future on Ether.Bitpush: Will CME launch Ether option very soon?Tim McCourt:  I mean right now, we're focusing on making the futures market for ether as successful as possible. In general, at the exchange, before we introduce options, we'd like to make sure the underlying futures market is developed enough to handle both the delivery of options, which are on seeing these things for futures exchange. We have options on futures. And to make sure the market can handle the associated Delta hedging of options on a daily basis. So we would like to make sure the futures market is developed and robust enough before we introduce options.Bitpush: Will you foresee CME launch another major cryptocurrence futures in the near future? The third cryptocurrence futures.Tim McCourt: Again, we'll kind of take our cues from our customers. They are certainly very good at telling us what they need us to focus on. Right now our focus is on bitcoin and recently launched ether futures only being on the second day of trading, but we'll continue to listen to customers. We do think that CME is the natural home for cryptocurrency futures trading, so we'll be working closely with them to figure out what makes sense the product development, but no exact plans right now.Bitpush:  ETH futures volume reached $33 million on day one. As you said in the interview that the response of ether futures is overwhelmed. Is this surprised to you or is just as you expected?Tim McCourt\uff1aI would say we're very pleased with the day one success. Yesterday we had 388 futures contracts traded on ether futures which is worth 19,400 ether equivalent, because the multiplier for each of futures is 50 ether. So it's a larger multiplier. And that's been great. We're really pleased that success.  In terms of building futures markets, in general, let alone on something that is new and exciting as cryptocurrency for market participants, to  have not only a very good order book in terms of price discovery but also have almost 400 contracts trade with over 230 contracts of open interest established in the first day is a great achievement. I would say it exceeded our expectation.Bitpush: That's wonderful. But yesterday also the big news is that Tesla spent one $1.5 billion to buy bitcoin. Do you think big companies as Tesla buying bitcoin, will this drive more institutional users or big companies into this crypto market?Tim McCourt:  It's hard to say exactly what will motivate corporations. Generally speaking, as they look to adopt cryptocurrency for their own purposes, but I think it's not only just Tesla.  There's been a host of companies that have announced the use about Bitcoin in their treasury functions, allocating part of their capital structure to cryptocurrency as well as accepting cryptocurrency payments. So I think in general, the corporate adoption of cryptocurrency will only further reinforce the use case of cryptocurrency, whether it be bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. I think that's a general positive development for the ecosystem and will certainly encourage other institutions to figure out if it makes sense for them. Bitpush: As someone commented that CME\u2019s ether future will introduce new people and organization to crypto and to the smart contract of ecosystem. So, do you think CME ether future will let more institutional investors to come into this market?Tim McCourt: It's hard to predict the future. I absolutely believe in the premise and that's part of our hypothesis. When we look at the success we had with introducing institutional accounts into bitcoin by using bitcoin futures at CME, we do believe that trend will also manifest and continue for ether. That's largely because when we look at what CME provides, we provide a regulated venue that is essentially clear to provide market participants a way to manage their risk or to access the underlying market. That is something that a lot of institutions want. They want to transact at a regulated, trusted, efficient venue. So, the feedback we have heard there are institutions that are looking to become involved in the trading of ether or invest in ether, but they can't do so in the underlying digital or spot market. So they'll plan to use CME futures the same way bitcoin or other futures that we have at the exchange as well.  I certainly believe that the institutional adoption of ether futures will bring new participants into the ecosystem a little early to tell on day two, but I do believe it will happen, but we just don't have that type of data yet, but certainly we're hearing from customers.Bitpush: Many people believe the regulatory uncertainty is a potential risk for the crypto industry and crypto market. What does CME think of the current crypto regulation?Tim McCourt\uff1aIn general, we're very supportive of the regulation and think regulation as a feature and not a bug of the offering for listed futures in the United States where our primary regulator is the CFTC(Commodity Futures Trading Commission). And I think a collaborative relationship that we have with our regulator. We have in an open and honest dialogue about what we're thinking and how to bring these products to market, and that communication is essential for the product success and development. I think it's a very helpful regime and environment to bring products to market, because it gives confidence to those participants that they can trade on a regulated venue in a regulated manner. And that's, like we said, it's a very attractive feature of CME offering. I do think as we look at additional product development, we also would expect that those conversations and dialogue to be ongoing in nature with our regulator and with market participants to make sure that we can continue delivering products that meet the expectations of both our regulators and the market.Bitpush: Yeah, a lot of people think that it's very positive that CME released bitcoin and ether future.But three years ago when CME launched bitcoin futures, we know that a bear market followed and the price of bitcoin dropped a lot. But this time around ether seems not going to drop a lot after ETH futures lauched.Tim McCourt\uff1aIt's hard to say exactly what's gonna happen with the price. What's important to us is that when a buyer or a seller to manage their risk or access the market or manage their positions that they can do so efficiently in transparent and trusted manner. So that's what's really important to us.  I think when you look at the futures market, one of the benefit it provides is that ability to efficiently transfer risk or efficiently manage risk in your positions. The prevailing price of the market is always of enormous informational values. The market at large is in fact, where the last buyer and seller agreed to mutually exchange that risk at that price. So even if the price is moving up or down, the efficiency of price discovery is our responsibility to provide, but hard to say what direction, one way or another","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/3005113","Time":1612885235,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.017,"neu":0.827,"pos":0.155,"compound":0.9999,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.88,"pos_right":0.12,"compound_right":0.128,"Total Score":0.869115},"79":{"Title":"Bitpush Exclusive Interview: Why Pionex Believes They are the Best Centralized Exchange Option","Content":"Pionex, a cryptocurrency exchange opened in 2019, sets themselves apart from their competitors, like Binance and Coinbase, in many ways. Bitpush spoke with Jeremy Peng, Co-Founder and Product VP of parent company BitUniverse, about their built-in trading bots, extremely competitive fees, and robust, multi-layered security system.Pionex was established in 2019, and has been operating safely since its release, with no hacks or exploits. They are well regulated, and have a Money Service Businesses license from finCEN, a United States regulatory agency. They aggregate liquidity from Binance and Huobi, effectively acting more as a broker than a standalone exchange, meaning that users will not have to worry about a lack of liquidity or any differences in coin prices from the market price. Their main feature that sets them apart from their competitors is their trading bots directly available on the exchange. Anyone who uses the platform can take advantage of one of 12 bots, each tailored to a specific case in the market. Some are useful for bullish scenarios, and others for relative price stability. And the best part about these bots is that they are completely free, which is unheard of in the trading bot market, so anyone can take advantage of the increased volatility in the market and make extra cryptocurrency gains. \u201cSo [the increased volatility] does affect our Trading bots, but it's making our Trading bots more profitable. So it's a positive effect because Grid trading bot is designed to make profits from the volatility of the market.\u201dSince the bots are directly ingrained within the exchange, users can rest assured that even during times of high volatility, when the traditional API-based trading bots break, the Pionex bots will continue making money. The trading bots can help users earn anywhere from 15%-50% APR, or even higher if users want to take on more risk.\u201cSo even if you are sleeping or if you are having a vacation, you can leave the bot there and they can help you to make it about 15 percent to 50 percent of APR. And there's barely no risk. So you don't need to worry about it.\u201dNot only are Pionex bots good for beginners with little money, but also for large whales in the cryptocurrency space due to their extremely competitive fees. Right now, Binance charges 0.5% for instant buy\/sell orders. Pionex\u2019s fees are orders of magnitude lower, at a mere 0.05% fee. To put this in perspective, this means a user would have to spend $2000 before paying $1 in fees, compared to $200 on Binance.An exchange, especially a centralized exchange, is useless if their security does not guarantee that your funds are safe. Fortunately for Pionex users, there are multiple safeguards in place to ensure that your funds will never be lost. First, they use a blockchain security team to audit their project and ensure that there are no serious flaws. Second, the ten million dollars of funding they\u2019ve received from Banyan Capital, Shunwei Capital, and ZhenFunds could be used as compensation for any hack on the platform. Finally, they hold the majority of their funds in Binance, which is one of the most secure platforms available. This means that Pionex is arguably safer than Binance, since they also have their own security measures.\u201cIt is also core to Pionex to solve the security problems. So we have several ways to keep our users safe, our funds safe.\u201dEven though Pionex already appears to have many advantages over their competitors, they are not satisfied with stagnation. Instead, they plan to release new features to make their exchange even more enticing for cryptocurrency traders and investors. One of these features is the release of Pionex Lite, which will offer a cleaner and simpler user interface and a regulated fiat on ramp, which will be perfect for beginners. They also plan to release Pionex version two, which will continue to develop their platform.\u201cI want to say there are some new things we are going to publish in the future, in the near future...we will bring a brand new UI and every function to make the app stronger so the users will like it.\u201dPionex is well positioned to be competitive in the cryptocurrency exchange sector. At the moment, their biggest weakness is a lack of marketing and brand recognition, but this is one of their areas of focus in 2021. Cryptocurrency investors may begin switching to Pionex to take advantage of their lower fees, enhanced security, and simple-to-use trading bots. They will certainly be a name to watch out for in the near future. \u201cMaybe you are using Binance and it's good enough, but Pionex much better because you can't use the Trading bots in Binance and also the commission fee is half lower than Binance. And also the security of Pionex is as safe as Binance because our money is also in Binance. So why not just choose a better Binance than just being in Binance?\u201dBy Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/2966163","Time":1612790074,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.052,"neu":0.779,"pos":0.169,"compound":0.9986,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.659,"pos_right":0.341,"compound_right":0.6908,"Total Score":0.95243},"80":{"Title":"How is Robinhood\u2019s Suspension of GameStop Positive for Blockchain Adoption","Content":"Users are outraged at the stock trading app Robinhood due to their recent delisting of stocks such as GameStop, Nokia, and BlackBerry. As a result, some are hailing cryptocurrency and decentralized exchanges as a solution to this so-called \u201ccorruption\u201d in traditional finance and Wall Street.Recently, there has been turmoil in the stock market. In early January, users of the subreddit r\/WallStreetBets, a community created to discuss high-risk investing decisions, noticed that there was a massive opportunity to make money in GameStop. Redditors saw that hedge funds had been betting massive sums of money against GameStop, in an investing technique known as a \u201cshort.\u201d The Redditors decided to buy as much GameStop stock as possible in order to ruin the hedge funds\u2019 short positions and make a massive profit. Needless to say, their plan worked, and GameStop\u2019s stock managed to increase in price by over 2000%, an unheard of amount in the traditional finance world. Since their strategy worked so well, they continued buying other stocks that were being shorted, such as AMC Theaters and Nokia, and made the hedge funds lose billions. A lot of the trading was done on Robinhood, a stock trading and investing app used by Millennials. In an unexpected move, Robinhood suspended trading of these affected stocks, which helped the hedge funds that were bleeding cash, but hurt the average investor looking to make a quick profit. The official reason Robinhood cited for this suspension was due to some of the rules and requirements about liquidity for a brokerage. Nonetheless, this has caused outrage in the retail investment community, as it shows that the broker, which was literally named after someone who stole from the rich to give to the poor, seems to be on the side of Wall Street.This decision will have massive consequences for the future of finance, and has far greater implications than it seems at first glance. A stock broker, which is meant to be a neutral entity allowing for anyone to buy and sell legal assets, just took the side of hedge funds and greater regulations in investments. This means that the average person cannot and will not trust these platforms anymore as a safe, reliable, and censorship-free exchange platform. And this breach of reputation expands far beyond Robinhood. For the average investor, seeing that Robinhood can delist or suspend a stock means that Charles Schwab, Fidelity, M1 Finance, and every other brokerage also has that ability, and they can do it at their own discretion. It makes the average person feel as if they are not respected, and that they cannot win against the big money of Wall Street. For these users, cryptocurrency and decentralization might offer the solution. Proponents of blockchain have taken to Reddit and Twitter to spread awareness of how cryptocurrencies are censorship-resistant, and that there are already platforms built that are leaps and bounds better than current exchanges. Traditionally, in order for a person to trade U.S. stocks, they have to go through a registration process which has a \u201cKnow Your Customer\u201d requirement. This means that a user has to give their social security number, date of birth, address, and other sensitive information to the stock broker before they are able to trade. This regulation was created after 9\/11 to ensure that terrorists are not able to trade U.S. securities, but has many side effects. For one, it is more difficult for people not based in the United States to trade American stocks, which means there are billions of people who could be investing but are unable. Second, if any one of these brokerages experienced a hack or breach, millions of Americans would have their identities compromised, and would have to deal with identity theft.Blockchain solves this problem by being decentralized. Since there is no central authority for a decentralized application, there is no way to collect this information, so users around the world can use these apps and rest assured that nobody will steal their identity. There are already blockchain applications created to allow anyone to trade stocks, securities, and other assets. For example, the dApp Mirror.Finance uses synthetic assets to allow users to trade stocks such as Apple, Amazon, and Tesla. Unlike regular stocks, these can be held in a blockchain wallet, and offer the holder total control over their assets, instead of having to trust a broker like Robinhood to hold them. Not only are there ways to trade stocks on the blockchain, but also a robust infrastructure of decentralized exchanges that allow for censorship-free transactions. For example, Uniswap, a decentralized exchange based on Ethereum, allows anyone to trade ERC20 tokens without having to create an account. The platform has its own governance token, UNI, which allows holders to vote and make decisions about the platform. No changes to the Uniswap exchange can be made without a formal vote by Uniswap token holders. This means that if a government forced Uniswap to shut down or delist a token, they would not be able to do so without a Uniswap governance vote, and it is highly improbable that holders of the token would agree to these demands. As a result, the Uniswap platform is a compelling solution to the problem of centralized exchanges being able to delist whatever asset they want.If Uniswap and Mirror.Finance were used together, then anyone, anywhere in the world, would be able to trade whatever assets they wanted, without there being much risk of regulation. This realization could explain why Mirror\u2019s governance token, MIR, has doubled since January 20th, and why Uniswap is up over 1000% from it\u2019s all-time low. When retail investors begin to use decentralized blockchain applications over the traditional stock brokerages, volume on the platforms will skyrocket, and will most likely propel these projects to new heights, in both volume and token price. Only time will tell whether or not Robinhood continues to bow to the will of hedge funds and big money, but regardless, their reputation has already been tarnished. Once users realize that solutions like Uniswap and Mirror.Finance exist, and solve all of the problems that a centralized exchange like Robinhood has, there may be a mass migration to these platforms. This type of movement would greatly increase the adoption and use-case of cryptocurrencies, and offer greater support for the idea that blockchain is spearheading a financial revolution. Update: On February 1, Robinhood said users could now buy up to 20 shares of GME. Though this is an improvement over the initial suspension, it still shows the problems with a centralized system, including liquidity failures, the need to report to regulatory agencies, etc. By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/2876371","Time":1612175175,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.078,"neu":0.809,"pos":0.112,"compound":0.9814,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.714,"pos_right":0.286,"compound_right":0.5574,"Total Score":0.9178},"81":{"Title":"Binance Unveils Global Report on Crypto Investors\u2019 Motivations, Behaviors, and Preferences","Content":"Binance, the global crypto exchange, recently published its 2021 Global Crypto User Index report which examines data from over 61,000 crypto users across 178 different countries and regions and explores the respondent\u2019s demographics, attitude, financial involvement, adoption, and ideology.Binance\u2019s study reveals that 55% of the users polled buy crypto assets for long term investments.

Why is This Happening and Will it Continue","Content":"In recent weeks, DeFi projects like Uniswap, Aave, Curve, and Chainlink have seen their tokens increase significantly in value. This growth in DeFi has not been seen since the summer of 2020, and represents a new wave of DeFi excitement, fueled by Layer 2 solutions and big money.In the Summer of 2020, DeFi experienced its first surge into mainstream cryptocurrency popularity. On June 21, there was about $1.5 billion of value in DeFi. By September 21, that value had increased nearly tenfold to $9.74 billion. This is due to a number of factors, including the proliferation of yield farming and its incredible three-to-four-digit returns, decentralized exchanges and liquidity pools, and the retail investors\u2019 desire to find the next Bitcoin. All of these factors created a cryptocurrency market that is today nearly inseparable from the idea of DeFi, and now DeFi promises to democratize and decentralize the economy, and bank the unbanked. Naturally, this caused DeFi tokens to rise in price, as investors saw an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of these finance applications. For example, Chainlink\u2019s LINK token increased 4x in value since the start of the summer, and Yearn.Finance\u2019s YFI went from $1,000 to $40,000. However, for the majority of these projects, the hype tapered off, and the token prices fell back down to earth. Recently, though, these projects have seen another increase in their token price, and this time it appears to be due to more than just hype and speculation.During the Summer, Ethereum fees spiked as network congestion due to the DeFi craze grew, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy where more hype created more congestion, creating higher fees and lowering the use-case for DeFi. As a result, users could expect to spend fees as high as $100 to do a simple Uniswap transaction. This demolished the potential for DeFi to bank the unbanked, as $100 is a transaction fee only acceptable for people making transactions worth tens of thousands of dollars. Current gas fee for a Uniswap transactionSince then, Layer 2 scaling has become a viable solution to the problem of Ethereum\u2019s high fees and long transaction confirmation times. Projects like Loopring pioneered the space, and created one of the first decentralized exchanges based on Layer 2 scaling technology, which allowed users to trade ERC20 assets for pennies, instead of hundreds of dollars. Their first-mover advantage caused their token to increase by twenty five times its value at its all-time low. Other DeFi projects have also begun preparing for Layer 2. Uniswap, for example, is planning on using a Layer 2 scaling solution in their V3 upgrade, which will significantly increase the speed and decrease the cost of their transactions, so much so that they will be able to possibly compete with the likes of Binance and Coinbase. When this happens, Uniswap can expect the value locked in their platform to increase significantly, which could increase the price of their UNI governance token, which effectively controls what happens to the funds locked in the platform. Holders of the governance token could vote on proposals that give them dividends related to how much value is locked in the platform or the volume of trading fees. These possibilities have led many investors to choose UNI as a long-term DeFi play that could potentially offer dividends in the future. Another project planning on implementing Layer 2 is Aave, the decentralized lending protocol. Typically, projects build on one Layer 2 solution, and each solution is incompatible with one another. For example, Matic Network Ethereum cannot directly interact with Loopring's DEX unless they go through the original Ethereum blockchain and pay the noraml fees. To mitigate this problem, Aave plans to make themselves available on multiple different layer 2 solutions, giving them the greatest exposure possible. Theoretically, AAVE holders could also vote on governance decisions to further their profit, and they can also stake their token in Aave\u2019s built-in insurance platform. The more funds at risk, the more security is needed, thus the greater return for the AAVE staking.Some projects have been able to indirectly benefit from the increased usability of DeFi projects. For example, Chainlink\u2019s price recently hit an all-time high of nearly $25, cementing it as a top 10 cryptocurrency. When projects that rely on Chainlink begin to scale, their growth will indirectly correlate to Chainlink\u2019s growth, since there will be more need for a decentralized oracle.  Similarly, the MKR token, which governs the DAI stablecoin, will also become more useful when the use of DAI becomes more prevalent. One final example will be Yearn Finance, whose aggregation of lending protocols will be effentizied by cheaper transactions, thus made more valuable.Another possible explanation in the recent rise of DeFi is the cryptocurrency hype cycle. Traditionally, there has been a pattern to how the cryptocurrency market increases in value. First, Bitcoin booms, which brings lots of money and attention to the cryptocurrency space. Then, investors start looking for the next big thing, which leads them to invest in Ethereum. The cycle continues, and investors then turn their wallets to some of the more significant alt coins. In this specific bull run, those coins are the likes of LINK, UNI, and other DeFi tokens. Furthermore, when the big money that is investing into the likes of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust look to further diversify into cryptocurrencies, they will no doubt find the DeFi movement quickly. In fact, Grayscale filed for the creation of an AAVE trust, among other coins, on January 27, which would undoubtly bring lots of institutional money into the DeFi space. The consistent and continual improvements to the largest and most promising DeFi projects has led their underlying tokens to skyrocket in value, and lead the total value locked in DeFi to reach upwards of $25 billion. Not only that, but also the potential for Wall Street investors and more regular people finding DeFi only further the potential for the fledgling industry. Though three-digit yield farming may have been a fad only seen by the incredible speculation of Summer 2020, investors seem to believe the possibility for anyone to cheaply invest, trade, and take control of their finance will certainly be here to stay.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/2835070","Time":1611865099,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.013,"neu":0.875,"pos":0.111,"compound":0.9963,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.49815},"83":{"Title":"Uniswap V3: Everything We Know About the Future of the DeFi DEX","Content":"Uniswap, the premier decentralized exchange on Ethereum, has been hinting about an upgraded version of their platform for many months. They plan to add lots of new features in order to ensure that they continue to be the top DEX, including greater scalability, cheaper transactions, and direct competition against centralized exchanges.Since its launch in 2018 at Devcon 4, Ethereum\u2019s yearly developer conference, Uniswap has been a staple in DeFi. It allows for anyone to trade ERC20 tokens and Ethereum in a completely decentralized manner, no KYC needed. Initially, Uniswap V1 was a simple automated market maker protocol, in which users could put funds into a liquidity pool, and receive trading fees from people who use the platform. For example, someone could put 1 ETH and 1000 USDT into a liquidity pool, and every time a transaction was made using ETH and USDT, that liquidity pool provider would get a small piece of the total transaction cost. This was revolutionary in the decentralized exchange sector, and quickly gained lots of traction. However, the technology was still nascent and more of a proof-of-concept than a final product.Graph of liquidity on Uniswap V1In March 2020, Uniswap V2 was released, and it offered many benefits over its predecessor. These improvements included: greater price accuracy using oracles, which helps make the DEX manipulation-resistant, and flash swaps, which are incredibly useful for DeFi traders looking to capitalize on arbitrage, along with plenty of minute changes which increased efficiency and security. One of the most significant changes made was the beginning of the implementation of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, that will control the future of the protocol. This paved the way for the release of their governance token, UNI, which was airdropped to users of the exchange in September 2020. The token helped propel Uniswap to having upwards of $3 billion locked into their platform, which made it the biggest project in DeFi.Even though Uniswap already sounds like they have a completed project and are ready to cash in on their hard work through their UNI token, the project is far from finished. There are many significant problems plaguing the network. One of these is the extremely high transaction fees during Ethereum congestion, which can sometimes reach upwards of $100. This makes the platform practically unusable for anything except the largest trades. Additionally, competitors like Sushiswap, which clone Uniswap\u2019s code and create their own exchanges, have been responsible for Uniswap losing lots of value. These attacks are called \"vampire mining,\" since the cloned exchanges attempt to suck the liquidity out of the original protocol. These attacks on Uniswap result in greater fees for users and more volatility for liquidity pool providers. Uniswap V3 has been teased since Summer 2020, and was supposed to have officially announced their technology updates by the end of the summer. However, due to reasons we can only speculate about, the team has yet to release any concrete information, other than tweets and teasers. However, these tweets give insight into how the protocol plans to reclaim its position as the number one DeFi project. The first feature expected for Uniswap V3 is faster and cheaper transactions through the utilization of a layer 2 scaling solution. In October of 2019, Uniswap created a demo exchange, which shows how Optimistic Rollups can scale transactions. It has the potential to offer fees for less than a penny and transaction times less than a minute. The demo is no longer working, which could be a sign that Uniswap is preparing to bring this to their main platform.Another feature which has been mentioned by the protocol\u2019s founder, Hayden Adams, are more efficiencies, which will lower fees even more for users. This means that Uniswap V3 has the potential to compete with centralized exchanges like Binance, and has the possibility to undercut them on fees. A side effect of all these improvements is that V3 will be incredibly technically complex. As a result, Adams claims it will be much more difficult to fork. This will be a positive for Uniswap, as more of the liquidity will stay with their platforms, as opposed to moving to other clones.At the moment, the release date of Uniswap V3 is anyone\u2019s guess. There is lots of speculation, but no concrete dates or time frames. The only true piece of news about the launch date was that Adams wanted to release information before the end of Summer 2020, but this window has been missed entirely. In all likelihood, the V3 launch will follow a similar cycle of V2, which means that a blogpost and testnet version will precede the mainnet launch. So, as soon as a testnet version is released, the mainnet will be a month or two away. The most likely time for release is sometime in the first half of 2021, since it was near enough to release last summer that Adams was almost ready to make an announcement.Having a quick, cheap, and decentralized option to trade any ERC20 token will be massive for the decentralized finance movement. Right now, the only people who can realistically use decentralized exchanges are those with enough money to not care about a $100 transaction fee. When the fees go back to being pennies per transaction, tens of millions of users will be allowed back into DeFi and capable of joining the financial revolution.One side effect of this opening of DeFi will be greater total value locked, or TVL, in Uniswap. This means that more people will be putting their money into the liquidity pools and getting a return. With more value inside Uniswap, the governance token, which effectively controls this money, will also become more valuable. Another side effect will be greater interest in the governance aspect of the UNI token. Theoretically, holders of the token could vote to receive a share of the fees made by the Uniswap exchange, thus increasing the value of the token and offering a dividend for holders. Unfortunately for other smart contract platforms, a usable Ethereum will degrade some of their use-case. The biggest argument for switching to EOS, Tron, or NEO is that they offer cheap and fast transactions, something Ethereum cannot do. However, when Uniswap is capable of this, there will be less need to use other platforms. The money that was in these smart contract platforms will come back to Ethereum, and it will further solidify its place as the king of smart contracts. Even though Uniswap V3 has yet to be officially announced, the Ethereum and Uniswap communities are eager for its release. It will offer cheaper transactions, fast confirmation times, and a viable alternative to exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Through these upgrades, Uniswap can expect to be at the forefront of DeFi, and be a pioneer in the space for years to come.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/2799529","Time":1611490304,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.034,"neu":0.87,"pos":0.096,"compound":0.9959,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.49795},"84":{"Title":"Bitpush Exclusive Interview: How Aave Plans to Make DeFi for Everyone","Content":"As Ethereum continues to grow in adoption and price, Aave has plans to make sure they are the primary DeFi protocol on the platform. Integrations Lead Marc Zeller told Bitpush News they plan to launch Aave on top of several layer 2 solutions in the coming weeks, are continuing to innovate with new ideas, and predict 20 million DeFi users by the end of 2021. The liquidity protocol Aave was launched in 2017 under the name ETHLend, and was one of the first decentralized lending protocols on Etheruem. In 2020, they rebranded to \u201cAave,\u201d which is the Finnish word for ghost, and represents how they want to make a transparent and open financial system. They have achieved $3.5 billion in deposits from users since their launch, due to their constant innovation and relevancy in the DeFi space. Some of their most useful features include flash loans, stable borrowing rates, and credit delegation. All of these features are available on a diverse range of nearly 20 ERC20 tokens, and the protocol is insured for $220 million and has the most audits of any DeFi project.On DefiPulse, Aave ranked #1 in total value locked for lending platforms, and plans to keep this position as scalability comes to Ethereum mainnet. Each Layer 2 solution is separate from one another, so funds on Matic Network cannot be transferred to Loopring without going through the main Ethereum blockchain, for example. In order to mitigate this problem, Zeller stated Aave will be on multiple Layer 2s, and sooner than you might think:\u201cAave has a multi-market approach. So it will not just be one Layer 2 solution, but actually several\u2026 That\u2019s the top priority for Aave for Q1 2021\u2026 there has been very active development and we are very close to the finish line.\u201dThe Aave team strongly believes that Layer 2 will revolutionize Ethereum, and make high transaction fees laughable.\u201cPeople in this summer will discover DeFi and be on board on DeFi and they will never believe us when we will tell them how much we spend in 2020 in transaction fee. They will just not believe us because for them, dozens of actions will cost like one dollar or cents.\u201dEven though Ethereum is the biggest DeFi platform currently, there are competitors looking to take its spot. Two of these are Cardano and Polkadot, which have seen significant price increases in this bullrun. Aave is open to the idea of building on these platforms, making the protocol multi-blockchain and opening it up to even more users. \u201cExpanding decentralized finance services outside of Ethereum, of the Ethereum playground, to discover new programs, to meet new user base, to onboard new kinds of assets. And that's probably going to be one of the main focus[es] of 2021\u2026 we call [these platforms] the New Frontiers.\u201dIn the current global economic situation, banks have interest rates near zero percent, and some even have negative rates, which means that ordinary people get extremely low interest rates on their money, and have very little incentive to save. This is unprecedented in the world economy, and there is a lot of uncertainty about what will happen in the global financial market. Aave is positioned to offer users the ability to earn interest on their money, including stablecoins, during these times, and reach an audience of billions of people looking for a safe place to store their money. \u201cIn a world of negative interest rates for deposits, having like four to six percent on DeFi even on the long term will be incredible.\u201dAfter the XRP lawsuit in late December, some investors are worried that the cryptocurrencies they hold will be classified as securities, and regulated by the U.S. Government. Aave is not concerned about this possibility, as they are sufficiently decentralized.\u201cIf you own the AAVE asset, you own the Aave Protocol\u2026 Compared to what happened in Ripple Labs\u2026 the holding of the Aave asset is very much distributed.\u201dAs the \u201cSwiss Army Knife\u201d of DeFi, Aave has plenty of use cases, but they are continuing to develop, even reaching out to the community through hackathons and sponsorships that will help the community grow. \u201cThe main specificity and features of Aave is innovation, innovation, innovation, and we will not stop there\u2026 We have, as of today, more than one hundred and fifty integrations of the Aave Protocol.\u201dAave is adamant in the fact that DeFi is not a fad, and it will be here to stay. They predict that the proliferation of blockchain applications, such as NFTs, gaming, and speculation, will lead the DeFi ecosystem to have 20 million users by the end of 2021, and Aave is taking this opportunity to build the financial tools of the future. \u201cI'm ready to bet on 20 million users in 2021...Let's make DeFi for everyone.\u201dThe transcript for the full video can be found below: Bitpush: Hello, everyone, thank you for joining us. My name is Lincoln Murr and I'm here with Marc Zeller, integrations lead at Aave. So first off, can you explain what Aave is for those who are unaware?Marc Zeller: Yeah, for sure, Aave is a liquidity Protocol. So basically, we are the financial middleware for what we call Decentralized Finance so, anybody with assets can deposit their assets into the Aave Protocol and basically make that liquidity available for borrowings and act as lenders. And obviously, if someone borrowed that available liquidity, they would pay interest and that interest would seamlessly go back to you as a liquidity provider. So it's a cool and decentralized way to gain passive income on your assets and make your money work.Bitpush: So what do you think makes Aave stand out from some of the other lending protocols? Why do you think that is the biggest at the moment, with over two billion dollars in locked value?Zeller: Yeah. So basically, Aave is not a new project because we started the project in 2017 when we were called ETHLend, and basically we launched a new version of the Protocol, which is the name Aave, in January 2020. So slightly more than a year from now. And we grew from zero dollars of deposit to three point five billion dollars to date. And I think one of the main reasons for our growth and our success and the adoption of Aave within Ethereum and the blockchain community was the innovation that we provide to the ecosystem. So we basically created and standardized on the borrow side the stable rates. We created functions and features such as flash loans that increase the average yield for depositors. We listed a very diverse set of assets. There's more than twenty one assets listed on Aave. That's more than any other Decentralized Finance platform available as of today. And we keep iterating on innovation and we also are the most audited Decentralized Finance Protocol of the ecosystem and we also introduce safety modules. That is a protection led and managed by the Aave token holders that protects the Protocol to up to 220 million dollars as of today. So we have the largest protection of the Decentralized Finance ecosystem as well. So all these little things add up to to give a clear advantage of Aave compared to the other solutions.Bitpush: So Ethereum fees have been skyrocketing lately. Does Aave any plans to lower fees and move to a layer two solution to help with Scalability?Zeller: As we announced in our last community meetings and community call that we did a couple of weeks ago, there's very active development being done on the Aave in order to reach an upgrade from Ethereum one to Ethereum Layer 2 and basically Aave has a multi-market approach. So it will not just be one layer two solution, but actually several. And the idea is to make DeFi accessible to anybody, no matter what is the size of the portfolio, because one of the main issue and drawbacks and pain points of very high transaction fee on Ethereum is that if you don't have a significant portfolio, it just doesn't make sense to use Decentralized Finance services because Aave has very interesting yield and passive income for depositors. But if your transaction fee is like fifteen dollars, twenty dollars, twenty five dollars and your portfolio is one hundred dollars, you will need years, even of 10 percent APY rates of returns in order to recoup your investment of depositing into Aave or any other DeFi platform. And that's why we are very much focused and that's the top priority for Aave For Q1 of 2021, to deploy at least the first implementation on Aave, on layer two as fast as possible. And I cannot share specific details because we will not spoil the fun for the community. But what I can share is that there has been very active development and we are very close to the finish line. Transaction fee would be a thing of the past. People in this summer will discover DeFi and be on board on DeFi and they will never believe us when we will tell them how much we spend in 2020 in transaction fee. They will just not believe us because for them, dozens of action will cost like one dollar or cents. So it would be a complete game changer. And a biding shift for the newcomers.Bitpush: So would you ever consider expanding Aave to another smart contract platform like Polkadot, Cardano, any one of those?Zeller: Yes. So right now we have to share that we are born and raised in Ethereum. We are an Ethereum based project. And most of our skills, most of our expertise are on what we call EVM based chain. So Ethereum virtual machine developments. But that doesn't mean there's not a future in what we call internally the new frontiers. So expanding Decentralized Finance services outside of Ethereum of the Ethereum playground to discover new programs, to meet new user base, to onboard new kinds of assets. And that's probably going to be one of the main focus as well of 2021, because right now we are working very hard on Ethereum based layer 2 solution.But I think the natural next step is to expand what we call the new frontiers.Bitpush: So AAVE token can serve as many different purposes on the platform, like the governance and staking. Are you worried that there's going to be some sort of regulatory backlash or the claim that Aave is a security like we're seeing right now with XRP?Zeller: The main difference between Ripple labs and Aave is that Aave is decentralized and completely decentralized.So basically, if you own Aave, if you own the AAVE asset, you own the Aave Protocol. And that's completely clear. We have these AIP system where adding a new asset, doing a modification on the Protocol create new markets. All of that needs to be enforced directly from a technical perspective. It's not just from a political perspective, if I can use that word, but also from a code perspective. You need to actually have the approval from the token holder in order to make the Aave Protocol involved. And the second thing is that the holdings compared to what happened in Ripple Labs or the Protocol like that, the holding of the Aave asset is very much distributed. And for example, the Aave genesis team doesn't have like a huge percentage of the supply.There's been a few investors into Aave that has been on board from 2017 to 2020, but their holdings also represent a fraction of the total supply because it is not a new project like ETHLend was done in 2017. So it's been years that the supply has been distributed to tens of thousands of hands, even hundreds of thousands, and that makes it much more decentralized.So I don't have any significant concern about that.Bitpush: So Aave has been referred to as the Swiss Army knife of I mean, there's so many different purposes and utilities on the platform. Are there any future plans you have to add more features, or is this about what we can expect from Aave for the long term future?Zeller: I think everybody that followed Aave and you know and knows that's one of the main specificity and features of Aave is innovation, innovation, innovation, and we will not stop there. That's many things we want to build. Together with the community, there's more and more community development. So not directly part of the vision insisting that they are building new features. We also are community first and ecosystem first project. So we have, as of today, more than one hundred and fifty integration of the Aave Protocol. So people are building decentralized application on top of Aave, for example, defiserver.com that allows you to manage your position and your trading position on top of having all this kind of stuff.So. This is a marathon, and we didn't even really start yet. There's many things to come and there's many things to build and we will be together with the community.Bitpush: Incredibly exciting and like you said, you have a lot of community developers and Aave has recently sponsored the market make hackathon. Is sponsoring these hackathons another strategy to get more people to build on top of the Aave ecosystem and have other people build more features for you?Zeller: Yeah, exactly, and I think it's a strategy that paid off very well in 2020 and we will keep doing it in 2021. We were major sponsor of most hackathons on Ethereum in 2020. And there's two benefits to that. The first thing is to have a completely new, fully fledged application and ecosystem that builds on top of Aave and do their own business model. And they are all services that are that have been kickstarted and started in hackathons and then can bloom inside the ecosystem, things like DeFi server, but also Aavegochi. That is super interesting at I looking forward for the launch in early February on Matic all this kind of stuff. And also internally from the Aave Genesis team we hired probably our best developers from the pool of Hackathon participants we found this year. So guys like Lucas, that was the creator of Aave Watch, watch guys like David, that was the creator of Collateral Swaps. And so many other guys joined the Aave Genesis team because hackathons for us is the best venue to find the best talent that strengthened Aave and allow us to to have more open ways and more strengths to develop new features.Bitpush: So if you think the Aave team has one goal for 2021, what would that goal be and why?Zeller: I think like the major first goal and something that we want to achieve as fast as possible is to bring back DeFi DeFi as a financial tool for everyone. Not a very cool and interesting tool, but only for the rich. We want people that own one hundred dollars and even less than that to be able to enjoy it and take their own path to financial freedom.Bitpush: So what do you think is your favorite sort of application that's used Aave to build something? Would you say it's the Aavegochi one you talked about earlier?Zeller: I like these kinds of games and I think gaming is like the key to our use case because Decentralized Finance I see it as a method where as an enabler for creating the all the ecosystem that we allow to use cases that are more user focused to bloom. Because at the end of the day, when I say we want to create an application that will be used by five billion people, I don't think we will have five billion traders in the future. And I'm not even sure we want that like it is a good thing that everybody's a speculator, all these kinds of things. But if we can have the speculation work for the depositors and that interest and passive income that is collected from this speculation directly be used inside games, inside a no-loss ecosystem such as PoolTogether, which is also a great application. You can have the peculiar use case and help it grow, and probably it will happen this year. I'm ready to bet on that with you. And it's recorded. So let's see and let's look at that again about this prediction in a year is that right now the DeFi ecosystem is around one million people. But thanks to games and NFT based applications, all these kinds of cool stuff, on layer 2, we would have like 10 million users or even 20 million users. I'm ready to bet on 20 million users in 2021.Bitpush: All right, well, thank you so much for your time today. It is great to talk to you about how Aave is planning to revolutionize not only finance, but DeFi as well and bring it back to everyone, not just the rich.Zeller: Let's make DeFi for everyone","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/2770150","Time":1611234379,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.018,"neu":0.824,"pos":0.158,"compound":0.9999,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.87,"pos_right":0.13,"compound_right":0.128,"Total Score":0.869115},"85":{"Title":"Three Factors Explain ETH's Sudden And Sharp Correction","Content":"After an impressive 72 hour rally, Ether's price has crashed by as much as 7% over the past 24 hours, spelling trouble for ETH bulls. At the time of writing ETH is trading at $1,318 and is down 4.31% despite finally breaking past its 2018 all-time high price of $1,428 yesterday. Three factors help explain the sudden and sharp correction. PC: Ethereum Price via CoinMarketCapThe depreciation in Ethereum's value corresponds to a poor day for the top five DeFi assets with almost all of them trading down over the past 24-hours by at least three percent, data from Messari Research shows. UNI, AAVE, SNX, MKR and YFI are all reporting losses over the past day. All five of the DeFi assets began to see a shift towards losses early on Wednesday, January 20 near the same time as ETH's descent. PC: Top Five DeFi Assets via MessariThis may be only the beginning of Etheruem's troubles, as developers have started to explore alternatives to the Ethereum blockchain. While Ethereum 2.0's beacon chain recently launched with promises of curbing congestion and lowering fees, the ETH team still has a long road ahead before they have a fully functional and scalable sharded blockchain. Already in Janurary fees on the network have hit an all-time average high of $9.79.Emerging as one of the leading Ethereum competitors is Solana, which launched its mainnet in beta in March 2020. The project has received crucial support, including from CEO of FTX Exchange Sam Bankman-Fried who announced that Solana would be home to a new decentralized derivatives exchange, Serum. In addition to grabbing the attention of new projects, platforms like Cryptokitties have already moved to Solana to avoid the operations hurdles that come with Ethereum.The final factor to pull ETH to its price lows today is the slow-down of Bitcoin's weeks-long rally. Bitcoin and the rest of the altcoin market had been rallying in tandem as BTC started the week off strong at $38,360 and by the middle of the week BTC was pushing its recent resistance level at $40,000, but the leading cryptocurrency has fallen back down to $34,737 as of writing. The Bitcoin market took another hit early this week when analysts at JP Morgan Chase wrote that Bitcoin needed to break above $40,000 soon or face an even harsher correction. Ethereum bulls had been optimistic as ETH remained strong even as Bitcoin started to fade, but ETH has since followed Bitcoin's suit.

The sub-custodian is a trusted company qualified to custody the product\u2019s assets held outside of Canada. The long-discussed bitcoin ETF, therefore, becomes the hot topic again. Bitpush here creates an infographic regarding the timeline of the bitcoin ETF in the U.S. for you to better understand how the story happened. Bitcoin ETFs are exchange-traded funds that track the value of Bitcoin and trade on traditional market exchanges rather than cryptocurrency exchanges. They allow investors to invest in bitcoin without having to go through the hassle of using a cryptocurrency exchange while providing leverage to its priceSince Winklevoss filed with SEC the first bitcoin ETF in 2013, the SEC has rejected every bitcoin ETF so far. During the 8 years, no matter who filed the filling \u2013 ETF giant ProShares or leading crypto assets management corporation Grayscale, no matter what kind of assets the ETF invests in \u2013 including U.S. Treasury securities or just 25% of the total on bitcoin futures contracts, SEC quashes dreams of bitcoin ETF by rejecting them directly and forcing the applicants to withdraw. A great number of crypto assets and blockchain companies forwent the idea to issue the bitcoin ETF due to SEC\u2019s tough attitude. They then pinned their hopes on the European market, and crypto ETN or ETP. However, last December, Jay Clayton - the former chairman of SEC, concluded his tenure, which seems like a turning point for the crypto community.President-elect Joe Biden is expected to choose Gary Gensler, a former financial regulator, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive, to head the SEC, according to Reuters. More recently, Gensler has testified before Congress about cryptocurrency and blockchain on multiple occasions, pushing back against comparisons between cryptocurrencies and Ponzi schemes and declaring that the still-unlaunched libra token met the requirements of being security under U.S. law.At MIT's Sloan School, Gensler taught a course on cryptocurrencies and blockchains, calling the technology \"a catalyst for change in the world of finance and the broader economy.\"VanEck filed with SEC for its new bitcoin ETF just one week after Clayton\u2019s departure.\u201cAll indications from the SEC are that a bitcoin ETF still faces an uphill battle,\u201d said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, an investment advisory firm. \u201cThat VanEck has the confidence to file for a Bitcoin ETF might indicate some shifting viewpoints within the SEC. Clearly, a key to watch as this drama continues unfolding is whom President Biden taps as SEC chair.\u201dSuch an ETF \u201ccould be taken as bullish for Bitcoin because it does broaden the universe of investors who could be aware of Bitcoin,\u201d said Everett Millman, a finance expert with Gainesville Coins.However, JPMorgan strategists also indicated that approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the US could pull investors out of popular trade and erode key support of the cryptocurrency's lofty price since it would sap investor capital from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.By Sara Zhang","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/2760229","Time":1611038819,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.022,"neu":0.865,"pos":0.112,"compound":0.9906,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.4953},"87":{"Title":"\u3010Bitpush Biography Series\u3011The Ups and Downs of Xu Mingxing and Li Lin: Bitcoin Changes Their Life","Content":"In the six million years from the origin of mankind to the present, the history of human civilization has only developed for a few thousand years, but the changes brought by modern civilization and high technology are the most strokes in human history.In the 20th century, the Internet economy has experienced multiple cycles of outburst, bubble, collapse and then prosperity. Nowadays, almost everyone's lifestyle has been changed by the Internet.In the 21st century. Satoshi Nakamoto first proposed Bitcoin and blockchain in 2008. In 2011, China\u2019s first digital currency exchange was established. After 9 years, Xu Mingxing\u2019s OKcoin and Li Lin\u2019s Huobi have secured the top spot in China\u2019s exchanges. They were of the same age and started their businesses almost at the same time. Both of their names were shown on the Hurun Rich List in 2018 and 2020. They are competitors, but also share common interests.One is \u201cConservative\u201d, the Other is \u201cRisky\u201dLi Lin and Xu Mingxing both belong to the post-80s generation, and Li is three years older than Xu. In 2000, Li Lin was admitted to Tongji University with a high score of 640. He learnt all kinds of computer software by himself and worked part-time to support himself. Tsinghua University is his dream school. After four months of study, he became a graduate student majoring in Automation in Tsinghua University and got the degree in two years.Xu Mingxing chose a more \"risky\" path. After graduating from the Department of Physics at the University of Science and Technology Beijing, he was admitted to the Renmin University of China as a graduate student, however, he dropped out because he thought school was too boring and he wanted to do something different. Jack Ma, who was also from Jiangsu(a province in China), was already a household name at that time and he is Xu\u2019s idol.Join the Internet Boom and Start BusinessAfter graduating from college, Li Lin joined Oracle, a well-known foreign company, and began his nine-to-five white collar life. This is already a very smooth life for most people, but Li Lin is not willing to stay in his \"comfort zone\". He set up a social networking website \"Friendship Network\" with friends in an attempt to build a Chinese version of Facebook, but it soon failed.Then Li quitted his job and launched the \"Renrenzhe\" group-buy website in 2010. At that time, group-buy websites were very popular, and \"Renrenzhe\" was designated as group-buying search service. This time, Li Lin succeeded, and the number of users and turnover soared. Li Lin bought his house and car in Beijing and his bank account assets reached tens of millions.In contrast, before entering the digital currency market, Xu Mingxing's entrepreneurial road was stumbled. He failed several times.Xu's first venture was Wantuan, a group-buying website. At that time, the market had been dominated by Meituan, Lashou and many other competitors, so Wantuan was doomed to failure.He was CTO of Dodin, one of the largest Chinese reading platform. In 2011, the total number of its registered users reached 40 million and the total number of documents exceeded 100 million. But Xu was still thinking about his entrepreneurial dream. A year later, he chose to resign and enter the catering O2O field. Contrary to Li Lin, who had already successfully started his business at that time, Xu Mingxing failed again.Full of ConfidenceXu Mingxing has the characteristics of Subei people who do not bend to failures, and his two entrepreneurial failures did not make him flinch. His fate with Bitcoin started from a line in the American drama The Good Wife: \"Bitcoin is the future, real is gonna change.\" He bought hundreds of Bitcoins in 2011 at a cost of less than 20 US dollars.Li Lin, a successful entrepreneur at that time, was full of confidence and wanted to do something to change the world. After reading the Bitcoin white paper in 2011, Li Lin was fascinated by the principles of cryptography.At that time, China's Bitcoin market had not yet been opened up, and Japan's Mt.Gox had become the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world.Li and Xu almost targeted the weakness of China's Bitcoin market at the same time: poor trading experience, difficulties in withdrawing cash, fund security issue and so on.In 2013, Xu Mingxing set up the digital trading platform OKCoin. On September 1 of the same year, Li Lin's Huobi was established.Huobi VS Okcoin: Two Leading ExchangesIn 2013, a U.S. Senate hearing recognized the legality of Bitcoin, and Bitcoin has experienced explosive growth, peaking to more than 1,000 US dollars at the end of that year.Li Lin's Huobi has attracted a large number of users by permanently waiving transaction fees. It only took one year to become one of the largest trading platforms in China at that time. In 2014, Huobi received tens of millions of US dollars investment from Sequoia Capital.Xu Mingxing used Litecoin to open the market. At the end of 2013, the transaction volume of Litecoin on OKCoin reached 8.5 million, creating the highest record of global virtual currency trading platforms at that time.In addition to one million US dollars Angel Investment from the well-known investor Tim Draper, OKCoin also received $10 million in Round A financing and tens of millions of dollars in Round B and C. Investors include Ceyuan Venture Capital, Giant Network, Fliggy Capital and so on.Xu Mingxing became a successful businessman, and seemed to be getting closer and closer to his idol Jack Ma.However, on September 4, 2017, China issued a policy explicitly prohibiting any organization or individual from illegally engaging in token issuance financing activities, and all kinds of token issuance financing activities should be stopped immediately.Xu Mingxing and Li Lin shifted their business to overseas markets, and OKcoin was renamed OKEx. Yang Linke, the Chinese Bitcoin founder, who was on a par with them at that time, opted out.In October 2017, Bitcoin experienced the first high-light moment. From November 2017 to January 2018, the price rose almost one thousand US dollars a day. It has brought huge profits to exchanges.In 2018, the total trading volume of Huobi exceeded 200 billion US dollars, and the trading volume and revenue increased by more than 100% year-on-year.\"Whampoa Military Academy\" VS \"Huobi\"Success can never be achieved by one person alone. The two big names of OKcoin: Zhao Changpeng and He Yijun made great contributions in the heyday of OKcoin. However, both of them left OKcoin in 2015 and established Binance Exchange on their own. Now Binance has also become one of the largest exchanges and plays an important role in the international market.In 2018, Li Shufei's resignation was also a hot topic. Li Shufei is a well-known professional manager who has helped OKcoin complete the B round of financing and explore overseas markets. What's dramatic is that it only took 7 days from Li Shufei's public announcement of his resignation to joining Huobi.Li said, \"The first generation of OKcoin international team left, and not many people of the second generation are staying. So, people can not blame me for leaving here.\" He also revealed that Xu Mingxing is partial to technology and not good at communication. Xu likes to do things by himself and does not trust others.Xu Mingxing himself admits that he is the \"Whampoa Military Academy\" in the crypto field.The talent flow is normal, especially in the relatively small field of blockchain. Li Lin welcomes anything if it is good for Huobi. He once said in an interview with Odaily Planet Daily: \"Our idea is to give blessings to any executives who left Huobi and still maintain a good relationship with them.\"Executives who left Huobi don't mind being labeled as Huobi. Hu Donghai, the co-founder of Huobi, later established Fengwo Mining. Hu said at the first anniversary celebration that Huobi and its entrepreneurs \"have strength, bottom line, and be grateful to those who made contribution for them.\"Li Lin's Huobi Forest VS Xu Mingxing's Blockchain LayoutLi Lin has always wanted to build Huobi into a blockchain ecological network. As of September 2019, he has invested in more than 60 companies, covering almost the whole industry, such as wallets, mining pools, capital, research institutes, public chain and so on, known as \"Huobi Forest\".Xu's strategy is to invest in blockchain technology, including wallets, rating agencies, public chain, technical services, TokenFund and other projects.Huobi and OKcoin have jointly invested in blockchain media such as Mars Finance, Shenlian Finance, Huoxun Finance, and so on. They are also involved in Internet finance and established 58CM.com and Haoyouqian respectively.The hustle and bustle is all for profit. After years of ups and downs in this industry, the two founders are well versed in the way of survival. Embedding the blockchain into the traditional industry and entering the listing platform is also their big move.Huobi listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange through its equity investment in the traditional manufacturing company Tongcheng Holdings, and acquired the Japanese blockchain cloud service company Win Techno. After Tongcheng Holdings was renamed Huobi Technology, its stock price rose by more than 130%, and its current market value is about HK $1.2 billion.Xu's OK Group was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange through the foundation engineering service provider LEAP Holdings Group which later renamed OKG Technology Holdings, and now has a market capitalization of about HK $960 million.The Pressure of Public Opinion and The Way Out2018 and 2019 was very unfriendly to Xu Mingxing and Li Lin, and their scandals were raging on the Internet.Investing in virtual currencies in China is not protected by explicit law. The contest between ordinary investors and capitalists is basically \"hitting the stone with an egg\", especially in the fuzzy zone of regulation. The public response of exchanges has always been \"do not believe rumors, do not spread rumors\".According to the Beijing News, an investor who blew up his account of 30 million yuan said that OKEx promised to provide 300000 yuan (no cash withdrawal, only billing) with a compensation ratio of only 1%. For platform investors who can submit relevant evidences, OKEx provides 10%-15% compensation fee.A number of Huobi investors said that the platform previously asked investors to provide screenshots or screen recordings of platform downtime, otherwise there would be no compensation. Some investors received one-third compensation after submitting relevant evidence, but some said they had not received feedback from Huobi.Xu Mingxing tried to \"break the relationship\" with the exchange, saying that since October 2017, OKCoin and OKEx have been operated independently, and the two are just partners.In 2018, Xu Xing announced his resignation as OKEx CEO and became the founder of OK Blockchain Engineering Institute, focusing on the R & D of OKG Technology.As of September this year, OKG Technology has been reported on CCTV for the sixth time and has become a positive publicity model.Li Lin also slowed down his pace and admitted that the previous expansion was too hasty and took a lot of detours. He decided to take a sound approach and focus on the core business. In addition, Li Lin also emphasized that the core value of Huobi is \"righteousness and no evil\" and only earning money in a righteous way.There is a Long Way to GoRegulation has always been the \"Achilles heel\" of any entrepreneurial legend in the crypto industry. In last October, OKEx suspended withdrawals for 41 days after Xu Mingxing was asked by the police to cooperate with the investigation in a judicial case involving equity mergers many years ago. In November, it was reported that 17 core Huobi employees were taken away for investigation, and then officials came forward to refute the rumor. After that, they became more low-key and rarely appeared in the media news.Xu and Li are also exploring more ways of development. In order to catch up with the DeFi boom, both Huobi and OKEx have launched their own decentralized public chains: Heco and OKExChain. Huobi US, which has been out of operation for more than a year, has obtained a trust license from Nevada's financial regulator and is expected to return to the US market this year.Now when we type Xu Mingxing into the browser search box, his prefix has become OKG Technology. Obviously, he gradually moved away from the controversial OKEx exchange. As he said: \"I am ready to donate to the country in the future.\"Li Lin once said: \"By 2019, no matter what Huobi will become at that time, I will let it go. In the next ten years, I want to experience a different life.\" But Li Lin is still shouldering the responsibility and affairs of the exchange, perhaps giving up is more difficult than persisting.The cypto field has been ups and downs for seven years. Today, with the influx of new players, no matter where Xu Mingxing and Li Lin go in the future, their experiences are worth learning for later generations.PC: InternetBy Amy Liu, Mary Liu","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/2754901","Time":1610991056,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.048,"neu":0.861,"pos":0.091,"compound":0.998,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.499},"88":{"Title":"The Butterfly Effect: How an Exchange Hack Led to the Centralization and Censorship of Decentralized Projects","Content":"In late September 2020, the KuCoin exchange was hacked for over $250 million.

This has led some to argue that these cryptocurrencies are more centralized than they appear.On September 26, 2020, the centralized exchange KuCoin announced in a blog post that they had detected withdrawals out of their hot wallets. The hack resulted in a loss of $281 million in funds in many different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and plenty of ERC20 tokens. Though a devastating loss, KuCoin was quick to respond, and promised users that their funds would be reimbursed through their insurance fund. They also worked with other exchanges, such as Binance, Huobi, and Crypto.com, to blacklist all of the addresses associated with the hack so the hacker would be unable to exchange any of their stolen cryptocurrencies. Then, on October 3, CEO Johnny Lyu announced that the authorities have found a suspect of the hack. The result of this investigation is ongoing, but it appears that KuCoin have successfully prevented the hack from destroying their exchange, which is a far-too-common occurrence in the cryptocurrency space.Even though the users will get their funds back and it appears that the hacker has been found, his actions have caused irreversible effects to the cryptocurrency space. For example, the exchanges that blacklisted the addresses associated with the hack have spread concerns that they are centralizing the space and creating censorship. What\u2019s to stop these exchanges from one day preventing users that used their addresses to donate to a particular political campaign from using their service? These concerns about censorship in the space have led many users to look to decentralized exchanges as an alternative, as they are unable to blacklist addresses. As a matter of fact, this is exactly what the hacker did, as he used decentralized exchanges Uniswap and Kyber to launder his funds in a complicated manner in order to throw off authorities. Since these exchanges are decentralized, they do not require any identity verification requirements, so anyone can use them for any purpose, including laundering ill-gotten gains.  Though some privacy advocates may see the hacker\u2019s actions as proof that decentralized exchanges are a more privacy-focused alternative than their centralized counterparts, many others have expressed concern at the lack of regulation and the public perception of these exchanges. Much like how Bitcoin in the early 2010s was classified as a \u201ccurrency for buying drugs\u201d due to the proliferation of websites such as the Silk Road using it as their primary means of exchange, people will begin to see decentralized exchanges in an analogous manner, as a \u201cWild West\u201d of cryptocurrency trading where nothing is regulated. What action regulators may take is unknown to anyone, but regulation of any sort would be detrimental to a decentralized exchange, and there is a chance these exchanges would be required to fully shut down. This sort of action would completely destroy the budding DeFi movement and change the public perception of decentralized exchanges for the coming years.This highlights the complex relationship between CeFi and DeFi exchanges. In this instance, CeFi appears to be the more regulated option, which has insurance and features in place to ensure that only verified users can exchange cryptocurrencies and be a part of this global financial movement. On the other hand, DeFi looks like an unregulated and unmonitored anarchy zone where anyone, including hackers and terrorists, can launder money without any repercussions. However, it is not that simple: CeFi also now appears to be weak, and easily able to be hacked. Nobody wants to put their money somewhere where it can easily be stolen, and this hack has broken the trust of many users who keep their funds in their exchange wallets. Decentralized Finance and its trustless nature appear ideal for keeping funds in the hands of their owners, with the only risk of hacking being the risk that the wallet owner leaks their own private keys. Depending on the person and their comfort level with cryptocurrency, this hack either solidified their stance on CeFi being the right place to store their money, or encouraged them to only use DeFi in the future.The most controversial and centralized move made by affected cryptocurrency projects was to freeze or reissue their currency. One example is Tether, who froze twenty two million USDT inside EOS and Etheruem wallets used by the hacker. Tether is inherently centralized, as they hold all of their pegged USD in a bank, thus requiring the user to trust that they back up their funds 1:1. Nonetheless, this type of behavior causes concerns about what other reasons Tether would use to censor users from making transactions. Other projects, such as NOIA Network, Orion, and Silent Notary have created completely new ERC20 tokens and have issued them at the block before the hacks took place. This behavior from decentralized projects has confused many, as they are essentially rolling back any transactions that took place after that block number. Justifying the decentralization of these projects is difficult if they have the ability to reissue funds and censor their own token from being used. A lack of censorship is one of the key characteristics of a decentralized currency, and without it, the entire network is put in the hands of a few people, the developers. Other projects that did not do a token swap have frozen their affected tokens and plan to reissue new ones, another solution that is incredibly centralized and controversial.If any project can simply reissue their funds at any time, what is the value proposition for these currencies? Many people would not buy shares in a company if they knew that the company could invalidate their shares at any time and for any reason. These projects did not even hold a community vote to decide the fate of their network, but instead committed to their actions without any accountability. Even though the hack was not their fault by any means, and all of the blame should be on KuCoin, many argue that the irreversibility and immutability of cryptocurrency has no exceptions. This event has set a precedent that these cryptocurrencies can be controlled by a few people, which will most definitely get the attention of regulators everywhere.As easy as it would be to call this the beginning of the end for every cryptocurrency that exhibited centralized behavior, it is not that simple. A lot of the projects that were affected are still in development, and thus have full control over their project. If they did not have control, they would not be able to continue to develop their project, and would have to rely on the time-consuming and complicated community governance decisions, which would stifle innovation. Furthermore, a lot of those projects have incredibly small market caps (at the time of the hack Silent Notary had a $100,000 market cap, Orion had $19 million) and any sort of large trade can significantly influence the price. If the hacker was able to sell their tokens, it would have tanked the price, and the projects may never have been able to recover. The projects consider the freezes and swaps a necessary evil which will allow them to eventually complete and decentralize their projects. We simply cannot expect these projects to deliver all of their goals while they are still very early in their development. A good example of a project that has delivered their project and decentralization is Uniswap. First, they created a world-class decentralized exchange, but allowed themselves total control over the governance to ensure that any unexpected glitches or bugs could be dealt with appropriately, and so they could easily add in any new features. Then, they released their governance token, UNI, to users of the platform, and allowed the community to have control over the future of the project.  Another consideration these projects had to consider was the ethics of their actions. They knew the hacker had malicious intent and stole funds from users, could they stand idly by and let him get away with it if they had the power to stop him? The argument can be made that these decisions should not be made by project developers, as they created a project with the intention to not regulate user transactions but find themselves doing the regulating. However, when the success of their project is on the line, they did what they had to to ensure their developer fund and token would not become worthless.  Even though this seems like an unprecedented situation, Ethereum went through a similar controversy in 2016 after the DAO hack. This hack allowed someone to exploit a bug found in a smart contract worth $150 million.Due to a bug, a hacker was able to hack the smart contract and drain all of the funds. Investors were panicked, and the future of Ethereum was uncertain. If the hacker decided to sell their stolen ETH, it would tank the price of Ethereum, and the Ethereum Foundation, whose funds were held majority in ETH, would have trouble continuing to fund the development process.A hard fork was proposed by the founders of Ethereum, including Vitalik Buterin, which would return all of the funds to the users, and it would be as if the hack had never happened and the smart contract did not exist. As one might expect, this was an incredibly controversial decision, as many considered blockchains to be immutable, and the idea of rolling it back to a previous state seemed like a recipe for disaster and akin to bailing out banks. Nonetheless, Ethereum followed through with their decision, and it very well may have saved the project. Even though the majority of people supported Ethereum\u2019s decision, there was a vocal minority who continued to support the original blockchain, which became known as Ethereum Classic. Vitalik still believes this was the correct move, as he has been quoted stating,\"When such a large fraction of the ecosystem is at stake, it's worth rethinking things... A portion of the community did not download these ocde patches and implement the fork and they just said we will continue running our own, our old chain.\"Had it not been for the rollback, Ethereum very well may have faded into obscurity with the likes of MtGox, Cryptopia, and other cryptocurrency hacks. In fact, this is happening with Etheruem Classic right now, as they are getting 51% attacked frequently and their blockchain is stagnating in development. Due to the slight bit of centralized action on the part of the main development team, Ethereum has become stronger, more decentralized, and in a position to claim its title as the \u201cworld computer.\u201dFor this reason alone, many of these projects can be forgiven for their centralized action. Even though it appears to be bad for the projects, it has saved many from becoming dead blockchains, and will hopefully lead to these projects one day becoming mainstream in the cryptocurrency space.  In order to prevent another hack and controversy again, both users, exchanges, and cryptocurrency projects need to work together to secure their platforms. All users should strongly consider buying a hardware wallet to store the majority of their funds, as this is the safest place to keep any amount of cryptocurrency. Exchanges need to implement stricter security standards and buy larger insurance plans in order to mitigate risk and loss potential. Finally, cryptocurrency projects should consider creating a governance system that tokenizes votes about the future of the platform.

Highlighting numbers from Bitcoin\u2019s realized cap on Jan. 12, Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics resource CryptoQuant, said that the cryptocurrency had taken far less of gold\u2019s market cap than previously claimed.As Bitcoin grew in price towards the end of 2020 and hit all-time highs of $42,000 last week, a narrative appeared that investors were swapping gold for BTC and that Bitcoin had thus taken around 7% of the precious metal\u2019s market cap of $10 trillion. Using realized cap, which calculates market cap in a different, more precise manner, the real \u201ctheft\u201d from gold actually stands at 2%, says Ki.Ki Young Ju's Tweet, Source: Twitter\u201cPeople said $BTC took 7% of the Gold market cap. No, it's not. There are unclaimed, unreachable, and lost Bitcoins. Based on the realized cap, it's just 2%,\u201d he tweeted alongside a realized cap chart, \u201cIf digital gold replaces 10% of the $XAU market cap then the $BTC price would be $154k.\u201dThe formula to calculate Realized Cap, Source: Glassnode AcademyThe motivation for Coin Metrics to create the concept of Realized Cap was the realization that \u201cMarket Capitalization\u201d is often an empty metric when applied to cryptocurrencies. Market Capitalization, borrowed from the world of equities, is calculated for cryptocurrencies as circulating supply * latest market price. However, unlike with equities, large fractions of cryptocurrencies tend to get lost, go unclaimed, or become otherwise inert through bugs.By design, there is no Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation which keeps track of everyone\u2019s stock certificates. So, when tokens or virtual coins get lost, they stay lost. In Bitcoin, this means that roughly 15% of supply is assumed to be permanently lost and out of circulation. Market Cap does not consider these nuances, instead of aggregating the value of all coins ever mined and assessing them at the last market price.The realized cap attempts to improve on the market cap by trying to discount coins that might be lost. Its crux is to value different part of the supplies at different prices, instead of using the daily close as the market cap does. After the calculation, Bitcoin\u2019s realized cap stood at $227 billion on Wednesday, while its standard market cap was $645 billion.Bitcoin\/Gold Price, Source: Buy Bitcoin WorldwideDespite its arguably slower progress, Bitcoin is still faring extremely well against gold, which failed to recoup its losses in BTC terms even as BTC\/USD dropped to near $30,000 on Monday.

Maker, Aave, Uniswap, Compound and Synthetix hold the top five spots with $3.83 billion, $2.68 billion, $2.54 billion, $2.41 billion and $2.32 billion, respectively. TVL was coined by DeFi data analytics platform DeFi Pulse and is used to judge the popularity of various DeFi protocols. The value reports how much crypto is committed to smart contracts. TVL has risen drastically over the course of the summer as DeFi protocols have become increasingly popular. In mid-May TVL first broke past $1 billion and today that figure stands at $20.92 billion.While TVL has become an indicator used to rank DeFi protocols, it has also become a point of controversy in the crypto community as people have begun to question its legitimacy. The first thing to note is that TVL is highly dependent on the price of ETH, as the price of Ether rises so too does the value of TVL. At the time of writing ETH is nearing its all-time-high price of $1,149 and is up 4.12% which will impact TVL reported on DeFi Pulse. To get around this shortcoming, it makes more sense to look at TVL in terms of ETH rather than dollars. This graph shows a similar story to the dollar graph, in mid-May there was 2.65 ETH locked in DeFi and today there is 6.7 million ETH locked in.Another weakness of TVL is that it can rise when assets move around within DeFi protocols, as opposed to only rising when new assets are invested. Additionally, if a protocol lets a user deposit ETH and also borrow ETH on deposited ETH collateral, the TVL on the platform would be misreported by DeFi Pulse.Founder of Encode Club Damir Bandalo tweeted about the weaknesses of TVL back in August writing that the same assets get counted multiple times on DeFi Pulse. He used his own calculations to estimate that at the time there was $3.5 billion locked in the top 15 DeFi protocols compared to the $6.7 billion DeFi Pulse reported.\"As we know DeFi is all about composability but that makes it hard to accurately count how much money is truly locked in the system,\" Bandalo wrote. \"It gets very easy to count the same $ multiple times.\"Through his calculations Bandalo discovered that in August only 3.85% of ETH and 0.18% of BTC locked in DeFi, leaving lots of room for futher investment. He added that stablecoins made up 33% of value locked, ETH made up 50% and BTC is 10%.

But, because of that, payments giant PayPal who serving 340 million customers worldwide has hit a new record in cryptocurrency transaction trading volumes. According to data from Nomics, PayPal has set another record with its cryptocurrency transactions on Monday as $242 million in the digital currency changed hands, which has broken and doubled the previously set record of $129 million a week earlier.Source: NomicsOn Twitter, Alex Saunders, a popular account in the Australian crypto community, pointed out that PayPal doubled its previous crypto trading volume record yesterday, the day BTC\u2019s price started recovering, by looking at the trading volume of cryptocurrency exchange itBit, the institutional-grade crypto exchange launched by Paxes that PayPal uses.The crypto currencies that PayPal allows to trade are actually custodied by itBit.

The analyst warned investors they should avoid becoming \u201cwhale food.\u201dHowever, it is not clear if the volumes were due to the increase in purchases during the dip, or traders were selling their holdings in a panic with the fall of prices. Whatever may be the reason, the crypto markets recovered following the news of the surged PayPal volumes.It\u2019s worth noting the direct involvement of PayPal with digital currencies came last year. PayPal announced in October of last year it would allow its customers to \u201cbuy, hold and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal account.\u201d  But the itBit volumes reflect what is going on at PayPal, with it seeing significant growth and in a very short time.

Loopring founder and CEO, Daniel Wang, told BitpushNews that the only way for Ethereum to change the lives of everyday users is by solving the scalability issue.Loopring is a layer two decentralized exchange protocol aiming to manage fees and avoid network congestion by leveraging zkrollups. Loopring has recently gained lots of attention in the cryptocurrency community, with their utility token, LRC, rising over 2.5x since the beginning of the year, and over 25x since January 2020. With Loopring, users no longer have to spend tens of dollars to send a simple transaction from address to address, and the cost of a decentralized exchange transfer goes from upwards of $50 during peak congestion to less than a penny. This is significant in helping Ethereum achieve its goal as the \"World Computer\" it set out to be, and allows for anyone, not just those willing to pay high transaction fees, to use the blockchain.According to Wang, Loopring is a \u201ccombination of a wallet and Layer 2 solution\u201d which will allow for users to be able to use zkrollup technology to achieve extremely fast and cheap transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. However, the project did not start out with this goal. \"We do onchain order matching, but later we found out that scalability is an issue, so we switched to layer 2, so now we offer a zkrollup based layer 2 solution specifically for transfers, for AMM swaps, and for orderbook trades.\"Zk-Rollups, also known as zero-knowledge rollups, are an advanced technology used on Ethereum to achieve more scalability. Right now, Ethereum can only handle about 10 transactions per second, which is why it can sometimes take upwards of thirty minutes for a payment to go through. Zk-rollups work by taking hundreds, or thousands, of Ethereum transactions and \u201crolling them\u201d together into one large transaction, which saves users time and money. With this technology, Loopring can handle 3,000 transactions per second.The project is also a decentralized exchange protocol, and allows for users to have an experience like Uniswap or EtherDelta without all of the high fees associated with Ethereum.Not only does Loopring allow for fast and cheap transactions, but also they strive for the same level of security as Ethereum, and Wang wants the project to \u201cbe as secure as layer 1\u201d meaning that storing your funds in the Loopring wallet and on Layer 2 is as secure as Ethereum itself. Having fast transactions would mean nothing without strong security and the reassurance that your funds will not be lost or stolen, so this is a significant part of why Loopring has had success in onboarding users to their layer 2 solution. As of January 2021, they have over 10,000 Ethereum addresses using their Zk-rollup technology.The Loopring token, LRC, has seen a massive increase in price in the past few months. The token is not required for transactions, but instead offers users the opportunity to earn some of the fees received by the protocol. However, some exciting speculation around the future use of the token has no doubt helped the price as well, as Wang told us they are planning on creating new tokenomics for the LRC token within the coming weeks.Unlike many other cryptocurrency projects, Loopring is incredibly results-oriented, and has spent very little money on advertising, instead electing to use their ICO funds on creating a time of primarily engineers and developers. Wang stated he does not regret this decision, as it has led to Loopring\u2019s technology advancing significantly. However, he wants 2021 to be the year of growth, and plans on doing more promotions, marketing, and PR for the project. With the launch of Ethereum 2.0 coming in the next few years, which promises to fix lots of the scalability issues seen today on Ethereum, Wang is not phased about this undermining Loopring\u2019s purpose.\u201cWe feel like the sharding solution and the Zk-rollup solution, they can work together to scale Ethereum even further. They don't conflict with each other. They don't compete with each other.\u201dEven though Loopring is the primary layer 2 solution at the moment, Wang humbly admits that this may not always be the case. Instead of seeing this as the death of the project, he sees it as an opportunity to improve.\u201cWe have to be able to learn quickly and adapt to the fact that there are more even smarter people out there than we are. Sometimes we have to follow. Sometimes we have learned from others and we have to think more and dare to innovate in the future.\u201dBy Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/2669011","Time":1610021641,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.03,"neu":0.842,"pos":0.128,"compound":0.9976,"neg_right":0.161,"neu_right":0.73,"pos_right":0.109,"compound_right":-0.1779,"Total Score":-0.001575},"95":{"Title":"More Bad News Coming For XRP Proves Crypto Market Matured","Content":"There are more bad news coming for XRP, following the recent lawsuit filed against major US-based blockchain company Ripple - as yet another major exchange stops trading, an investor sues Ripple looking to force a stock redemption, and the number of addresses with XRP 1m or more has dropped sharply.

How can we sort out the facts from the mass of information, the truth from lies? Should technology giants be held responsible? How can blockchain rebuild the trust between people? Linkedln Co-Founder Eric Ly, founder of Hub talks with Bitpush News Editor in Chief Susan Feng on how to find truth in this age of misinformation. Bitpush: You co-founded LinkedIn in 2003, and now you found another blockchain project Hub.  So tell us a little bit about yourself what motive you to co-found LinkedIn?Eric: LinkedIn was founded almost twenty years ago when it was hard to imagine anyone putting so much of their personal information online. These days so much of our identities and information are online. It is very normal. We started linkedIn, Its goal was to put our professional reputation and professional network online. From that, I realized there was more to be done. I realized that the success of LinkedIn and other social networks created a problem: There was so much information created by so many people that it was hard to know whether someone\u2019s information was true and accurate.Hub is an attempt to fix this. Bitpush:Cool. Do you feel you see the next big thing?Eric\uff1aYeah, basically, the problem was that we come to rely on so much of information to make decisions about ourselves. Yeah. And in the case of linkedIn, it was really information about the people that we  rely on to create  business with, to have a relation with someone professionally.Do we want to hire them? We're making important decisions about this information. Hub is really an attempt to fix this problem where people might not be completely accurate about themselves.Bitpush: Yeah, absolutely.  LinkedIn which founded in 2003 back then that early days of internet, we all see these big tech giants the force that make the world of more open, prosperous place, like google you know they obviously will not do evil.But right now, the public opinion shifted dramatically.People raise concern about these big techs\u2019 size and power, the  handling of information like Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica scandal from early on to now,  as a pioneer of internet, how did you see the internet evolve over time? Eric:  Yeah, technology has really become too much of a good thing.It brought great value to everybody's lives in terms of convenience and knowledge. This progress has really shown some of the serious problems, and that exists with the technology you know today.So basically, you know what we found is that these data about people's information and behavior is really valuable.And the fact is, you know, its value is often put at risk because of our lack of understanding in terms of how to manage it. So you know today we don't really have a necessary tools to effectively deal with this data yet.And we need to figure out solutions so that we can continue to expand the value of this technology and this data While doing it without the problems that related the technology has created. Bitpush:  Nowadays as social media rise, everybody can be a news anchor, and everybody can have the impact on the society like a big news media outlet.So like some radical news organization have the same impact as the New York Times. And It's not only in the united states, you know China, everywhere. It seems it's a world problem,  not even mention in the united states. During the election, we can see the lies and conspiracy theories flooding on internet. So how do you think the big platform like Twitter, Facebook, Google, all these tech giants?What's their responsibility and duty to deal with this problem? We know that twitter, facebook,  give them some credit, take steps to take down or label false information, but obviously it's not enough. Eric: Yeah, that's right. The thing is that I do believe that technology companies are just like any other company. They have a responsibility to offer products that are you know beneficial and valuable you know to people. And in the case of social media companies, it's actually a very challenging goal to achieve thisbecause it is sometimes very difficult to know what is fact and what is fiction.And  if the companies in our industry  cannot stop these information from being spread, they should actually try to be explicit about the factual basis of this information itself. So people can decide on whether the information that they're getting is valid or not, right? And this means, I believe, associating with the information that they're getting. Whether the content is coming from a reputable source or is the information they can tell, factual or not?So this is the things I think what they have to do to help people interpret the information, they are accurate or not.Bitpush: It seems a lot to ask but think how much money they are making using our data. And also as I know some scholars, they suggest that tax the big platforms as the tax on tobacco industry. Because they spread a lot of bad information to society as tobacco harmful to people.And also right now in the United States, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, they all face antitrust and privacy lawsuit from U.S. government and china also launched antitrust probe into Alibaba. So what's your thought on that? Eric: Well regulation is often considered undesirable by companies because they feel like that infringes on their profit.It's useful to set some boundaries so that companies can play where you know it is safe. My only hope is that in terms of regulations that are made, when they're made by government and leaders, they are well informed and enlightened about the technology so that they don't limit the industry unnecessarily because these industries do contribute economic value to people as a whole. Bitpush: Yeah, of course you know if without this kind of company, we cannot work you know during this pandemic, right?Because of the internet, because of Google, Amazon, you know we can work in in this pandemic. We can buy things remotely. obviously they contribute a lot economically .But right now, this misinformation really let the society pay a big price for that. Eric: Yeah, you know it's really interesting because you have to often wonder what is that stake? Right? Sometimes people think oh it's okay If people you know uh believe uh things that are not necessarily true but i was reading recently  about some of the statistics around  misinformation. There was a recent article in the New York Times talked about how that engagement of articles that have false information on Facebook has tripled since 2016.When there was the last US election, when people became aware of this problemI think the most recent example is really alarming in terms of the information surrounding covid-19 and pandemic. There have been some recent surveys that have been done.they say that four out of ten Americans believe that Covid-19 is a conspiracy, which is very alarming.Bitpush: And the mask. A lot of people said mask is useless  as well as vaccine. Eric: That's right. There's a significant number of Americans who don't want to take the vaccine. So you know this is an instance where the misinformation itself is actually going to harm people and cause more deaths, right?So it's not just some kind of funny thing.So I think that's why it matters of health today, especially with the coronavirus, when we started the project around Hub we actually felt that economic opportunities and financial opportunities are really important and should be improved and that's really based on having accurate information about the people that we work with. Bitpush: We see that because the data algorithm is a key to the business profit of the tech platforms.Actually, spreading the misinformation to help keep people on platform. So if you ask the tech giants to take down this misinformation and take very harsh attitude, very strict on misinformation. In the end, actually, it's hurt that business. This is just like a little bit of contrary for the business instinct.They will do that for society\u2019s benefit, but if  they are  very serious about it.It will decrease people's spending time on the platform. It will not good for their data.Eric: Well you know Unfortunately, it's human nature for people to hear what they want to believe. And they want to believe things you know whether it is true or not as long as they promote their own belief.And for these technology platforms in an effort to promote engagement they've made it easy for people to see the information that they want to see.But I do believe that the problem right now is really just limitation that these platforms have, but I do believe that we should find ways to solve these limitations and to make these platforms better.Bitpush: Okay, great. Just as you said, people want to listen what they believe. So actually the social media instead of connecting people, they separating people,  it's like people who have similar opinion they form a group. They don't talk with the other groups. and it make the society even more divided.Eric: Yeah, that's right. Um that's I think one of the things that happen on Facebook.Where you know back 4 years ago, I think there was a big push to have people be more connected with their community, with their friends and family. And but one of the unfortunate side effects of that was that people became attached to these more intimate groups where they can share information among people that had similar beliefs that they did without necessarily being exposed to kind of the larger, more verified information that was out there, the news by reputable sources. So as a result, what happened was that these factions form between people uh that we're almost kind of like echo chambers.Bitpush: Yes. yeah it's even very obviously on Wechat you know.On Wechat during the election. People who for president Trump have one group, and people against president Trump  have another group. I have real experience that  for this group, if someone is really for president Trump, another people will organize another group to  kick them out. We only want to listen what we believe.Eric: Yeah, that's right. and so unfortunately, I think people have become more and more divided than they ever have before. And it's because of, I think some unintended consequences of this technology that have gotten this here. And so I do believe that there's more work to be done to really fix these problems and products today.Bitpush: And the data. Nowadays, no matter where you live, people in this world, all our lives are dominated by data, by the big platforms. They know where you are, what you like, who you love and where you travel. Our data is on that platform. They make huge profit from on our own data by using the algorithm.So what kind of rights do you think the user have over our own data? Eric: Well I think you know there's really no doubt that data has become kind of new currency, this new economy that we all live in. It has value.And right now, that data has been by the tech giants, and the consumers, they gained relatively little from their data, except maybe for the free use of the platform.And even then that is a controversial idea.This is a very inequitable distribution of value coming from the data.having grown up in a capitalist society and being a capitalist myself, I actually believe that we should reward people for the value of their hard work.  These entrepreneurs. But at the same time, I do believe also that we should  redistribute the value that data hasso that it's more equitable between people. And so people should actually benefit from more of the value of their data. Rather than kind of the big corporations always gaining from the value of this data. Bitpush: But how, Will blockchain helps?How can individual user own our data, will blockchain help?Eric: Well One of the very interesting things about blockchain is that it really promotes this idea of decentralization.As I've studied in blockchain over the years, this idea of decentralization that I think some of these major problems with big tech today can be solved.First of all, you have the ownership of the data that is really owned by the big technology companies todayWith the blockchain, you have the ability to actually decentralize the ownership of data so that people can take their data wherever they want to go and benefit from it. They in effect can have ownership of their data, and that's a very valuable thing, that is kind of the first step in gaining from the value of data. Bitpush: That's cool. The first step like you own the data but the another stop step is the trust.Have you heard that Alibaba, they sell the old customers priced higher than the new customers? So how can you believe this tech Giants?  How to build the trust?You know It seems hard to believe the tech giants and it's also seems hard to trust everyone we met on this internet.So what's the solution? Eric: Well I think the reality is that the world is becoming a bigger and bigger place? With many more actors that we have to interact with. Right? So it's going to be hard to, uh as they say, you know put the genie back into the bottle.So there's gonna to be a new reality where there's more people that we have to deal with.So I think the question is, how do we use technology to help us gain trust with more and more entities rather than fewer and fewer activities. So I think that um you know once again, I think technology can be a solution, but it has to be you know done in the right way. And part of what I've been trying to do at Hub to really look at how we can properly track information. One of the key ideas that I'm interested in is how do we get verified information. So if we're able to verify that a piece of information is true, then we're more likely to trust it, more likely to be able to make good decisions based on that. And so I think that's one of the other benefits of blockchain as well is that once we're able to capture a piece of information you know that it's verified, we can depend on it, and we can make the decisions based on it. Bitpush: Okay, cool. because I read information about the Hub. You said\u201d The challenges from the lack of trust will only get worse as people increasingly turn to the Internet for more interactions\u201d . Hub focus a lot on reputation and identity.  Are you trying to build user\u2019s reputation score to help people interact more efficiently? Could you tell us a little bit more about that? Eric: Yeah, you know it's very much of the same things as we've been discussing. And what we want to do, first of all, we want to capture information about people. This simply describe the reputation, but we want this to capture in a way that that information is verified. And it's truthful because without good information about people, it's hard to form good opinions about them. So that's the first thing.The second thing that we want to do is to make it possible using blockchain technologies to enable that information to really be owned by people. And what that means is that they can take it anywhere that they want to go. Bitpush: So they can take their own personal data and the credit score to go from one market place to another? Eric: That's right. And I think this is the key to sort of breaking up the control that you know big tech has around the data that's owned by individuals, because we know that information is valuable, but we want to place the control of that information into the hands of users. And by doing that, we enable them to be in control and to benefit from that information, rather than big tech companies.  So I don't wanna say that companies should not benefit from that information, but I think more of an equitable distribution, the value is going to be better for everyone. Bitpush: But how did you get started with blockchain? It's because you're pioneer internet. Now you're pioneer in blockchain so, how this idea come to you? Eric: Well you know It comes from, seeing some of the problems that exist today on the internet. And you do see that in general, some of the limitations we really reach some of the limits. In terms of what we're able to do with today's technology, as an entrepreneur, as a person who is looking to solve problems. I was always looking for new tools and to solve existing problems that I see. And so uh I think the real kind of advantage of blockchain is that you see it as a tool to solve some of these really challenging problems that exist with the internet technology today. So i'm actually very excited to work on blockchain because uh it really provides the answers for some of these really challenging problems. Bitpush:  A lot of young people also looking for the next big thing. They want to be part of them. Could you have some suggestion for young people? What they should do? how do they find a new career opportunity? How do they find the next big thing? Eric:  That's a great question.  I would say to look for opportunities that can have a positive impact on a lot of people.  And also look for opportunities that you can solve. There's basically two places to look. You can always look for opportunities for existing problems in a better way, or you can look for new problems that you have a solution. Two ways to look have opportunities that are really worthwhile. And there's never a shortage of problems. So it might seem that all the problems that have been solved, but that's never true. The best advice I always got was to apply yourself and that's that you are very capable, everyone is very capable. They always have something to offer. And it's a matter of finding what it is and apply yourself to. Bitpush: Yeah. As to you, you are a tech person. You went to Stanford university. So how did you find your opportunity? Eric: Well I think it's important to engage and interact with other entrepreneurs.  I was very lucky, growing up in Silicon Valley that there was always people who are always talking about new ideas and new dreams and new companies, and always being in the midst of other people who are always trying to push the boundaries. And uh you know here in silicon valley, there's a quite a rich kind of uh entrepreneurial spirit. Bitpush: Okay. Eric:  And I think it's really great to be in the culture like that. So i definitely encourage people to you know find uh people who are like that who are always exploring these things. Because in doing so, it will give you ideas of your own that you can solve uh that you know also very successful. Bitpush: But Do you have a philosophy by which to live? Eric: You know I would say, be open you know and uh always um you know be uh you know open to new opportunities uh as they come to you. okay Um you know Very important to keep an eye on uh you know new challenges and always look to the future and not necessarily so much the past. Bitpush:  Okay That sounds great. Thank you so much, Eric. Eric: Thank you, Susan. It's a pleasure talking.","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/2652950","Time":1609847942,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.047,"neu":0.785,"pos":0.168,"compound":0.9999,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.796,"pos_right":0.204,"compound_right":0.3182,"Total Score":0.897645},"97":{"Title":"Institutional Investors Are Flooding Into Crypto, But Is That Best For The Industry\u2019s Future","Content":"Crypto investments from institutional players including PayPal, JP Morgan, MassMutual, Square and Microstrategy have gotten enthusiasts excited about the possibility of blockchain and crypto moving into the mainstream, however bigger players in the industry may not be something to cheer about just yet.Bitcoin supporters hail the cryptocurrency as a store-of-value and hedge against inflation, while others argue the digital asset's price is driven upwards by speculative trading destined to crash. CEO and Chief Investment Officer at Alpha Sigma Capital, Enzo Villani, noted that crypto is starting to gain more attention from institutions in an interview with BitpushNews.\"We started seeing about three or four months ago, maybe six months ago, the naysayers who were always talking Bitcoin down or saying it was a scam or something now turning their tune around,\" Villani said.While trusts like Grayscale are currently a popular option for purchasing Bitcoin, Villani says bigger players will start turning to accounts they already hold for crypto exposure.\"The institutions have analysts, so they're going to go and say what's the most effective way to buy Bitcoin and they're going to find a way to do it,\" Villani said. \"Most of it is going to be through Fidelity custody, a large custodian they already have an account with.\"Crypto enthusiasts may be excited to see institutional players with more capital coming into the space, but Villani highlighted that these types of Bitcoin holders could be the reason Bitcoin has remained correlated with the S&P 500.\"You don't really want these guys in Bitcoin because they're going to play their own game and they have a lot of capital and you don't have as much capital even if you combine all of the people and be careful what you wish for,\" Villani said.Large entities \u2014 both foreign and native to the blockchain space \u2014 could also pose a threat to decentralization as bigger players buy-out smaller projects, Villani says.\"As some start to take market share and this becomes more established you'll just see acquisitions, so people will acquire them, the larger player will acquire them,\" Villani said. \"The weird thing about blockchain is that some of them are foundations, you can't just acquire the company. So you have a little bit of a challenge there, but I do believe that will happen.\"While Villani predicts a handful of blockchain projects will emerge as key components of the blockchain economy, he also believes interoperability will be an important aspect of the new system.\"Some blockchains are more useful for speed and they give up a little bit on privacy or a little bit on the security side. Some blockchains are slow like Bitcoin on the transactional side,\" Villani said. \"So I think you're going to have different blockchains applied for different industries.\"Villani believes that once Coinbase goes public the industry will see a host of blockchain companies following suit, however they will all have to be aware that traditional finance will still be competition.\"If you're a large crypto exchange all NASDAQ already has a crypto trading platform built with their software and they're all nationalized exchanges, so all they have to do when it's more established is just turn on the software,\" Villani said. \"Then you might have 125 exchanges that are nationalized, government-tied regulated exchanges. The crypto exchanges are going to get boxed out of the real money.\"Institutional entities are adding crypto to their portfolios regardless of what's best for the industry and while Villani doesn't think the space needs institutional money to grow, he knows Bitcoin's price rising will leave some people excited.\"I think you're running into a place where I don't think they need traditional finance, but if big money starts buying Bitcoin the price goes up. That's the bottom line and anyone who owns bitcoin now of course wants the price to go up.\"By Emily Mason","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/2593443","Time":1609168865,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.024,"neu":0.89,"pos":0.086,"compound":0.9869,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.691,"pos_right":0.309,"compound_right":0.7783,"Total Score":0.95561},"98":{"Title":"What are the Best Blockchain Advancements of 2020","Content":"2020 has been a year of advancements in the blockchain sector with key events including Bitcoin\u2019s new all-time high price, DeFi's rise to becoming a multi-billion dollar industry and Wall Street investing in blockchain assets. Unlike the bull run of 2017, which was fueled by rampant speculation, retail investors and a little bit of market manipulation, this current bull run seems to be based in something more tangible: technology advancements. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most notable blockchain technologies that have been introduced in 2020.Uniswap V2Decentralized exchange Uniswap, one of the catalysts for the DeFi craze, released their Version 2 in May 2020. It allows for anyone to send and receive any ERC20 token on Ethereum and has technical efficiencies over its predecessor, Uniswap V1. Decentralized exchanges existed long before Uniswap, but Uniswap's simple interface has allowed the project to support over $50 billion in volume since its release. Eth 2.0 Phase 0The long-delayed upgrade to ETH 2.0 began this December with the release of Phase 0. This phase activated the beacon chain, which will coordinate the network. Its concensus mechanism is proof of stake, unlike Ethereum's current proof of work concensus, and the Phase 0 upgrade allowed users to begin staking Ether to secure the new network. Even though this has no benefits to the network congestion or transaction times on Ethereum, it signals the network's move to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism which developers say will enable Etheruem to act as the \"World Computer.\" With the following phases of development, Ethereum will introduce sharding, a technology that promises scaling to over one hundred thousand transactions per second at a fraction of the cost of today\u2019s transactions.Zk-Rollups and Other Layer 2 Scaling TechnologiesWith massive transaction volume on Ethereum came lots of congestion, which led to slow transaction times and high network fees. Unfortunately, ETH 2.0 is still a work in progress, so Ethereum needed a solution as soon as possible in order to ensure that their network was still usable. Fortunately, Zk-Rollups became a viable solution for fast and cheap transactions. This protocol \u201crolls up\u201d hundreds, or thousands, of transfers into one transaction. This method means less data is used to create the transaction, leading to lower costs. Then, using zero knowledge proofs, the transactions can be published to the Ethereum blockchain without requiring data about the transaction, hence the \u201czero knowledge\u201d aspect.The leader in Zk-Rollup technology is Loopring, a decentralized exchange platform that also created a wallet allowing for person-to-person transactions on Ethereum with near-instant finality and a cost of a thousandth of a penny. Even though this solution is not widely used at the moment, Ethereum now has a viable solution to the current problem of network congestion.Polkadot Mainnet LaunchPolkadot, one of the largest blockchain interoperability protocols, had its initial whitepaper release in 2016. It wasn\u2019t until late 2020 that the mainnet was released. Even though this release date is almost half a decade after the idea for Polkadot came about, no one can deny the technical significance of this event. Now, there is a way for blockchains, like Bitcoin and Etheruem, to communicate with one another. This means that DeFi-like applications can be available on Bitcoin and many other blockchains, instead of being exclusive to Ethereum. Just months after release, Polkadot is already a top 10 project with a market capitalization around $5.5 billion, and nobody knows how high it will go.Filecoin LaunchFilecoin had their mainnet launch in late 2020 after a $200 million ICO in 2017. The purpose of Filecoin is to act as a distributed and decentralized cloud storage option. It uses the Interplanetary File System, IPFS, protocol to create an efficient and secure peer-to-peer network. This technology could be the future of storage as we know it and represents a significant step in the direction of decentralization for the internet. Cardano Shelley UpgradeAfter being criticized as \u201cvaporware\u201d in the 2017 bull run, Cardano has been able to prove that they stand a chance at being a true Ethereum killer with their Shelley upgrade. This mainnet launch allows for holders of the ADA token to begin staking with pools and delegators. This update, much like Phase 0 for Ethereum 2.0, is a stepping stone on the path to full smart contract functionality on Cardano. Future updates are slated to occur in early 2021, and Cardano will finally be a standalone smart contract blockchain.Synthetic Assets and IndicesThanks to projects like Synthetix, anyone, anywhere in the world, can hold assets like gold or the NIKKEI 225 Japanese index in their Ethereum wallet. Synthetix\u2019s mainnet launch allows users to collateralize the SNX token and receive a synthetic asset in return. If the price of SNX locked up and the price of the asset somehow become imbalanced, there are mechanisms in place to ensure that the synthetic asset does not experience a price shock or lose significant value. These types of applications are finally making the dream of global financial freedom a reality for the billions of people without a bank account.Yearn Finance and Yield FarmingWith the proliferation of decentralized borrowing and loaning services, such as Compound and Aave, and decentralized exchange liquidity pools, like Uniswap, it was only a matter of time before somebody discovered a way to maximize profits, and that person was Andre Cronje. He created Yearn Finance, a protocol that finds which DeFi service has the highest yields and automatically deposits cryptocurrency into that platform, effectively creating a robo-advisor that constantly finds the best yields in DeFi. Though a seemingly simple dApp, it has made DeFi even more profitable for many investors, and will be relevant as long as DeFi is around.Moving ForwardThe technological advancements made in blockchain this year are significant and help justify the massive price increases in some of the biggest cryptocurrencies. More and more projects, like Filecoin, Polkadot, and Cardano, are transitioning from an ICO and an idea to a real-world use case and blockchains with value. In 2021, if this rate of advancement continues, cryptocurrency and blockchain projects may begin to see more adoption and use, and allowing them to achieve their goals of becoming global financial tools.By Lincoln Murr","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/2592123","Time":1609142063,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.03,"neu":0.826,"pos":0.144,"compound":0.999,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":0.625,"pos_right":0.375,"compound_right":0.6369,"Total Score":0.944685},"99":{"Title":"Decentralized Platform Metis Aims To Bring Web Communities To Blockchain","Content":"MetisDAO, a new protocol aiming to drive the mass adoption of web communities onto the blockchain, has announced that Chief Technology Officer and Co-Founder of CasperLabs Medha Parlikar is joining the team as an advisor. The partnership comes ahead of the launch of the Casper network mainnet scheduled for the first quarter of 2021.The Casper Protocol is a layer one public blockchain designed to support the governance of protocols through a range of features. Through partnership with Parlikar, Metis will help bring web communities into the Casper ecosystem by providing blockchain-based tools to organize and manage their projects in a decentralized way. In her advisory role, Parlikar plans to support Metis in pursuing their shared goals.\u201c[I see my role as] definitely getting [Metis] to work with the Casper protocol we have great alignment because they want to support the scaling out of adoption of decentralized organizations and enabling those organizations to use blockchain technology and we have the exact same goal we want to scale out the adoption of blockchain technology by making it intuitive,\u201d Parlikar said.By making it easy to utilize blockchain, Metis and CasperLabs plan to spur mass adoption of the technology. When organizers of an open-source project want to use the Metis protocol, they register their decentralized autonomous company (DAC) and an Ethereum address is assigned to the decentralized company. Community members can then join and connect with the address with little to no knowledge of the blockchain technology underpinning the product.\u201cThey can build up their own decentralized community here and leverage the community power to drive to govern the project development not by some giant warehouse or arbitrageurs,\u201d Co-founder and product lead of Metis, Kevin Liu, said. \u201cWe hope it could be fully decentralized to give back the power to the community members.\u201d \u201cMetis is the enabler,\u201d Parlikar said.CasperLabs\u2019 pure, proof-of-stake blockchain promises to support an array of protocols, including Metis, with web assembly for smart contract execution, high scalability, low cost and high security. While proof-of-stake comes with greater security risks, Parlikar and the CasperLabs team has been working for two years to research and develop a secure proof-of-stake system.\u201cIt's really about efficiency and block times, so [with proof-of-stake] you can propose a lot more block times and get a lot more transactions throughput because you're not rate limiting the rates at which blocks are proposed because of the efforts in mining,\u201d Parlikar said.The two companies each have independent reputation tracking systems which create decentralized business credentials within each community.\u201cA lot of these governance protocols today they have this notion of a whale effect where you can just buy a bunch of governance token and sit on it,\u201d Parlikar said. \u201cWe have a very different way where you can earn reputation through actions and that\u2019s stored in your keys separate from your tokens, so it's a great way to reward contributions but you separate the monetary aspect, the token aspect, of it from reputation.\u201dThe Metis protocol has its own reputation system where users earn points for their collaboration efforts or through staking. CEO of Metis, Elena Sinelnikova and Liu see lots of potential applications for the points, for example to use similarly to credit scores to determine who is most likely to pay back loans.\u201cThe alignment in goals because we\u2019re all working towards mass adoption, Sinelnikova said. \u201cWe know what blockchain technology and we love it and would like to bring it to web communities.\u201dBy Emily Mason","Url":"https:\/\/en.bitpush.news\/articles\/2453118","Time":1607513583,"Emotion":"1","neg":0.02,"neu":0.886,"pos":0.094,"compound":0.9869,"neg_right":0.0,"neu_right":1.0,"pos_right":0.0,"compound_right":0.0,"Total Score":0.49345}}
